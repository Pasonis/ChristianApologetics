## <a id="kjv-galatians"></a>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians


### <a id="kjv-galatians-1"></a>Chapter 1

Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)<a id="kjv-galatians-1-1"></a><sup>1</sup> And all
the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:<a id="kjv-galatians-1-2"></a><sup>2</sup> Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus
Christ,<a id="kjv-galatians-1-3"></a><sup>3</sup> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us
from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our
Father:<a id="kjv-galatians-1-4"></a><sup>4</sup> To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<a id="kjv-galatians-1-6"></a><sup>6</sup> Which is not another; but
there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of
Christ.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other
gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
of me is not after man.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
the revelation of Jesus Christ.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’
religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and
wasted it:<a id="kjv-galatians-1-13"></a><sup>13</sup> And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my
equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
traditions of my fathers.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb,
and called me by his grace,<a id="kjv-galatians-1-15"></a><sup>15</sup> To reveal his Son in me, that I might
preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh
and blood:<a id="kjv-galatians-1-16"></a><sup>16</sup> Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were
apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
Damascus.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
abode with him fifteen days.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-18"></a><sup>18</sup>

But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s
brother.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-19"></a><sup>19</sup>

Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie
not.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-20"></a><sup>20</sup>

Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;<a id="kjv-galatians-1-21"></a><sup>21</sup> And
was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:<a id="kjv-galatians-1-22"></a><sup>22</sup>
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-23"></a><sup>23</sup>

And they glorified God in me.<a id="kjv-galatians-1-24"></a><sup>24</sup>


### <a id="kjv-galatians-2"></a>Chapter 2

Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-1"></a><sup>1</sup>

And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which
were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in
vain.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled
to be circumcised:<a id="kjv-galatians-2-3"></a><sup>3</sup> And that because of false brethren unawares
brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have
in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:<a id="kjv-galatians-2-4"></a><sup>4</sup> To whom we
gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the
gospel might continue with you.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it
maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who
seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:<a id="kjv-galatians-2-6"></a><sup>6</sup> But
contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was
committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;<a id="kjv-galatians-2-7"></a><sup>7</sup>
(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of
the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)<a id="kjv-galatians-2-8"></a><sup>8</sup> And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived
the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the
right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and
they unto the circumcision.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which
I also was forward to do.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
because he was to be blamed.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,
fearing them which were of the circumcision.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being
a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews,
why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?<a id="kjv-galatians-2-14"></a><sup>14</sup> We who
are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,<a id="kjv-galatians-2-15"></a><sup>15</sup> Knowing that
a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of
Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be
justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for
by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-16"></a><sup>16</sup>

But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God
forbid.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself
a transgressor.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-18"></a><sup>18</sup>

For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto
God.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-19"></a><sup>19</sup>

I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live
by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-20"></a><sup>20</sup>

I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by
the law, then Christ is dead in vain.<a id="kjv-galatians-2-21"></a><sup>21</sup>


### <a id="kjv-galatians-3"></a>Chapter 3

O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not
obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set
forth, crucified among you?<a id="kjv-galatians-3-1"></a><sup>1</sup> This only would I learn of you,
Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of
faith?<a id="kjv-galatians-3-2"></a><sup>2</sup> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now
made perfect by the flesh?<a id="kjv-galatians-3-3"></a><sup>3</sup> Have ye suffered so many things in
vain? if it be yet in vain.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-4"></a><sup>4</sup>

He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the
hearing of faith?<a id="kjv-galatians-3-5"></a><sup>5</sup> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was
accounted to him for righteousness.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
children of Abraham.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In
thee shall all nations be blessed.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
things which are written in the book of the law to do them.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it
is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall
live in them.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree:<a id="kjv-galatians-3-13"></a><sup>13</sup> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit
through faith.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a
man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth
thereto.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
Christ.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-16"></a><sup>16</sup>

And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of
God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after,
cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
but God gave it to Abraham by promise.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-18"></a><sup>18</sup>

Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was
made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-19"></a><sup>19</sup>

Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-20"></a><sup>20</sup>

Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if
there had been a law given which could have given life, verily
righteousness should have been by the law.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-21"></a><sup>21</sup>

But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-22"></a><sup>22</sup>

But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto
the faith which should afterwards be revealed.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-23"></a><sup>23</sup>

Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,
that we might be justified by faith.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-24"></a><sup>24</sup>

But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
schoolmaster.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-25"></a><sup>25</sup>

For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-26"></a><sup>26</sup>

For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Christ.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-27"></a><sup>27</sup>

There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-28"></a><sup>28</sup>

And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs
according to the promise.<a id="kjv-galatians-3-29"></a><sup>29</sup>


### <a id="kjv-galatians-4"></a>Chapter 4

Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;<a id="kjv-galatians-4-1"></a><sup>1</sup> But is under
tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
elements of the world:<a id="kjv-galatians-4-3"></a><sup>3</sup> But when the fulness of the time was come,
God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,<a id="kjv-galatians-4-4"></a><sup>4</sup> To
redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
adoption of sons.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
then an heir of God through Christ.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which
by nature are no gods.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,
how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye
desire again to be in bondage?<a id="kjv-galatians-4-9"></a><sup>9</sup> Ye observe days, and months, and
times, and years.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have
not injured me at all.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel
unto you at the first.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record,
that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own
eyes, and have given them to me.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?<a id="kjv-galatians-4-16"></a><sup>16</sup>
They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude
you, that ye might affect them.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing,
and not only when I am present with you.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-18"></a><sup>18</sup>

My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
be formed in you,<a id="kjv-galatians-4-19"></a><sup>19</sup> I desire to be present with you now, and to
change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-20"></a><sup>20</sup>

Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
law?<a id="kjv-galatians-4-21"></a><sup>21</sup> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-22"></a><sup>22</sup>

But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he
of the freewoman was by promise.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-23"></a><sup>23</sup>

Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is
Agar.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-24"></a><sup>24</sup>

For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-25"></a><sup>25</sup>

But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
all.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-26"></a><sup>26</sup>

For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many
more children than she which hath an husband.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-27"></a><sup>27</sup>

Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-28"></a><sup>28</sup>

But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-29"></a><sup>29</sup>

Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
of the freewoman.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-30"></a><sup>30</sup>

So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
the free.<a id="kjv-galatians-4-31"></a><sup>31</sup>


### <a id="kjv-galatians-5"></a>Chapter 5

Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-1"></a><sup>1</sup>

Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
shall profit you nothing.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
debtor to do the whole law.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-3"></a><sup>3</sup>

Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-4"></a><sup>4</sup>

For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
faith.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
truth?<a id="kjv-galatians-5-7"></a><sup>7</sup> This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none
otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment,
whosoever he be.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

I would they were even cut off which trouble you.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not
consumed one of another.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
lust of the flesh.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-16"></a><sup>16</sup>

For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye
cannot do the things that ye would.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-18"></a><sup>18</sup>

Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<a id="kjv-galatians-5-19"></a><sup>19</sup> Idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
heresies,<a id="kjv-galatians-5-20"></a><sup>20</sup> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such
like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
God.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-21"></a><sup>21</sup>

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith,<a id="kjv-galatians-5-22"></a><sup>22</sup> Meekness, temperance: against such
there is no law.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-23"></a><sup>23</sup>

And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-24"></a><sup>24</sup>

If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-25"></a><sup>25</sup>

Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
envying one another.<a id="kjv-galatians-5-26"></a><sup>26</sup>


### <a id="kjv-galatians-6"></a>Chapter 6

Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-1"></a><sup>1</sup>

Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
deceiveth himself.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-3"></a><sup>3</sup>

But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-4"></a><sup>4</sup>

For every man shall bear his own burden.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good things.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap
life everlasting.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
especially unto them who are of the household of faith.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own
hand.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
persecution for the cross of Christ.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but
desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision, but a new creature.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
mercy, and upon the Israel of God.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-16"></a><sup>16</sup>

From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the
marks of the Lord Jesus.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

Amen.<a id="kjv-galatians-6-18"></a><sup>18</sup>
