## <a id="kjv-philemon"></a>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon


### <a id="kjv-philemon-1"></a>Chapter 1

Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto
Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,<a id="kjv-philemon-1-1"></a><sup>1</sup> And to our
beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in
thy house:<a id="kjv-philemon-1-2"></a><sup>2</sup> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-3"></a><sup>3</sup>

I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,<a id="kjv-philemon-1-4"></a><sup>4</sup> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus,
and toward all saints;<a id="kjv-philemon-1-5"></a><sup>5</sup> That the communication of thy faith may
become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in
you in Christ Jesus.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee
that which is convenient,<a id="kjv-philemon-1-8"></a><sup>8</sup> Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech
thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of
Jesus Christ.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
bonds:<a id="kjv-philemon-1-10"></a><sup>10</sup> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
profitable to thee and to me:<a id="kjv-philemon-1-11"></a><sup>11</sup> Whom I have sent again: thou
therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:<a id="kjv-philemon-1-12"></a><sup>12</sup> Whom I would
have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto
me in the bonds of the gospel:<a id="kjv-philemon-1-13"></a><sup>13</sup> But without thy mind would I do
nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but
willingly.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
shouldest receive him for ever;<a id="kjv-philemon-1-15"></a><sup>15</sup> Not now as a servant, but above a
servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto
thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?<a id="kjv-philemon-1-16"></a><sup>16</sup> If thou count me
therefore a partner, receive him as myself.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
account;<a id="kjv-philemon-1-18"></a><sup>18</sup> I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay
it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own
self besides.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-19"></a><sup>19</sup>

Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
bowels in the Lord.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-20"></a><sup>20</sup>

Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
that thou wilt also do more than I say.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-21"></a><sup>21</sup>

But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
your prayers I shall be given unto you.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-22"></a><sup>22</sup>

There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;<a id="kjv-philemon-1-23"></a><sup>23</sup>
Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-24"></a><sup>24</sup>

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.<a id="kjv-philemon-1-25"></a><sup>25</sup>
