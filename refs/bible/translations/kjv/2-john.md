### <a id="kjv-2-john-1"></a>Chapter 1

The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the
truth;<a id="kjv-2-john-1-1"></a><sup>1</sup> For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be
with us for ever.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from
the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-3"></a><sup>3</sup>

I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth,
as we have received a commandment from the Father.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-4"></a><sup>4</sup>

And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that
we love one another.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the
commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk
in it.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an
antichrist.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
wrought, but that we receive a full reward.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he
hath both the Father and the Son.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:<a id="kjv-2-john-1-10"></a><sup>10</sup> For he that
biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face,
that our joy may be full.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.<a id="kjv-2-john-1-13"></a><sup>13</sup>
