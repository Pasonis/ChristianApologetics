## <a id="kjv-2-timothy"></a>The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy


### <a id="kjv-2-timothy-1"></a>Chapter 1

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to
the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-1"></a><sup>1</sup> To Timothy,
my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my
prayers night and day;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-3"></a><sup>3</sup> Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful
of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-4"></a><sup>4</sup> When I call to
remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in
thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that
in thee also.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of
God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
according to the power of God;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-8"></a><sup>8</sup> Who hath saved us, and called us
with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
world began,<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-9"></a><sup>9</sup> But is now made manifest by the appearing of our
Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life
and immortality to light through the gospel:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-10"></a><sup>10</sup> Whereunto I am
appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am
not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he
is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me,
in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
Ghost which dwelleth in us.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away
from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-16"></a><sup>16</sup> But, when he was
in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus,
thou knowest very well.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-1-18"></a><sup>18</sup>


### <a id="kjv-2-timothy-2"></a>Chapter 2

Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
Jesus.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-1"></a><sup>1</sup>

And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,
the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach
others also.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-3"></a><sup>3</sup>

No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this
life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-4"></a><sup>4</sup>

And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
except he strive lawfully.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
fruits.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all
things.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from
the dead according to my gospel:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-8"></a><sup>8</sup> Wherein I suffer trouble, as an
evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they
may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal
glory.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall
also live with him:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-11"></a><sup>11</sup> If we suffer, we shall also reign with him:
if we deny him, he also will deny us:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-12"></a><sup>12</sup> If we believe not, yet he
abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the
Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the
subverting of the hearers.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto
more ungodliness.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-16"></a><sup>16</sup>

And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
and Philetus;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-17"></a><sup>17</sup> Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that
the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-18"></a><sup>18</sup>

Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that
nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-19"></a><sup>19</sup>

But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to
dishonour.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-20"></a><sup>20</sup>

If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel
unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared
unto every good work.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-21"></a><sup>21</sup>

Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-22"></a><sup>22</sup>

But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
gender strifes.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-23"></a><sup>23</sup>

And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
all men, apt to teach, patient,<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-24"></a><sup>24</sup> In meekness instructing those
that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance
to the acknowledging of the truth;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-25"></a><sup>25</sup> And that they may recover
themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him
at his will.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-2-26"></a><sup>26</sup>


### <a id="kjv-2-timothy-3"></a>Chapter 3

This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-1"></a><sup>1</sup>

For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-2"></a><sup>2</sup> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good,<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-3"></a><sup>3</sup> Traitors, heady,
highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-4"></a><sup>4</sup> Having a
form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-6"></a><sup>6</sup> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist
the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-10"></a><sup>10</sup> Persecutions,
afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra;
what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered
me.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving,
and being deceived.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-14"></a><sup>14</sup> And that
from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to
make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-16"></a><sup>16</sup> That the man of God may be perfect, throughly
furnished unto all good works.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-3-17"></a><sup>17</sup>


### <a id="kjv-2-timothy-4"></a>Chapter 4

I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-1"></a><sup>1</sup>
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers,
having itching ears;<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-3"></a><sup>3</sup> And they shall turn away their ears from the
truth, and shall be turned unto fables.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-4"></a><sup>4</sup>

But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of
an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is
at hand.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
the faith:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-7"></a><sup>7</sup> Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at
that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
appearing.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-9"></a><sup>9</sup> For Demas hath
forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto
Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he
is profitable to me for the ministry.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him
according to his works:<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-14"></a><sup>14</sup> Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath
greatly withstood our words.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me:
I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-16"></a><sup>16</sup>

Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that
by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles
might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-17"></a><sup>17</sup>

And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-18"></a><sup>18</sup>

Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-19"></a><sup>19</sup>

Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
sick.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-20"></a><sup>20</sup>

Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee,
and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-21"></a><sup>21</sup>

The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
Amen.<a id="kjv-2-timothy-4-22"></a><sup>22</sup>
