## <a id="kjv-titus"></a>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus


### <a id="kjv-titus-1"></a>Chapter 1

Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according
to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which
is after godliness;<a id="kjv-titus-1-1"></a><sup>1</sup> In hope of eternal life, which God, that
cannot lie, promised before the world began;<a id="kjv-titus-1-2"></a><sup>2</sup> But hath in due times
manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me
according to the commandment of God our Saviour;<a id="kjv-titus-1-3"></a><sup>3</sup> To Titus, mine
own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.<a id="kjv-titus-1-4"></a><sup>4</sup>

For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as
I had appointed thee:<a id="kjv-titus-1-5"></a><sup>5</sup> If any be blameless, the husband of one
wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.<a id="kjv-titus-1-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given
to filthy lucre;<a id="kjv-titus-1-7"></a><sup>7</sup> But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men,
sober, just, holy, temperate;<a id="kjv-titus-1-8"></a><sup>8</sup> Holding fast the faithful word as he
hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort
and to convince the gainsayers.<a id="kjv-titus-1-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
specially they of the circumcision:<a id="kjv-titus-1-10"></a><sup>10</sup> Whose mouths must be stopped,
who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for
filthy lucre’s sake.<a id="kjv-titus-1-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.<a id="kjv-titus-1-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
may be sound in the faith;<a id="kjv-titus-1-13"></a><sup>13</sup> Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and
commandments of men, that turn from the truth.<a id="kjv-titus-1-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled
and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is
defiled.<a id="kjv-titus-1-15"></a><sup>15</sup>

They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.<a id="kjv-titus-1-16"></a><sup>16</sup>


### <a id="kjv-titus-2"></a>Chapter 2

But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:<a id="kjv-titus-2-1"></a><sup>1</sup> That
the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity,
in patience.<a id="kjv-titus-2-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
things;<a id="kjv-titus-2-3"></a><sup>3</sup> That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love
their husbands, to love their children,<a id="kjv-titus-2-4"></a><sup>4</sup> To be discreet, chaste,
keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word
of God be not blasphemed.<a id="kjv-titus-2-5"></a><sup>5</sup>

Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.<a id="kjv-titus-2-6"></a><sup>6</sup>

In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,<a id="kjv-titus-2-7"></a><sup>7</sup> Sound speech, that
cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be
ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.<a id="kjv-titus-2-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
please them well in all things; not answering again;<a id="kjv-titus-2-9"></a><sup>9</sup> Not
purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the
doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.<a id="kjv-titus-2-10"></a><sup>10</sup>

For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
men,<a id="kjv-titus-2-11"></a><sup>11</sup> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;<a id="kjv-titus-2-12"></a><sup>12</sup>
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;<a id="kjv-titus-2-13"></a><sup>13</sup> Who gave himself for us,
that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works.<a id="kjv-titus-2-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
Let no man despise thee.<a id="kjv-titus-2-15"></a><sup>15</sup>


### <a id="kjv-titus-3"></a>Chapter 3

Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,<a id="kjv-titus-3-1"></a><sup>1</sup> To speak evil of
no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all
men.<a id="kjv-titus-3-2"></a><sup>2</sup>

For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and
envy, hateful, and hating one another.<a id="kjv-titus-3-3"></a><sup>3</sup>

But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
appeared,<a id="kjv-titus-3-4"></a><sup>4</sup> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
and renewing of the Holy Ghost;<a id="kjv-titus-3-5"></a><sup>5</sup> Which he shed on us abundantly
through Jesus Christ our Saviour;<a id="kjv-titus-3-6"></a><sup>6</sup> That being justified by his
grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<a id="kjv-titus-3-7"></a><sup>7</sup>

This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be
careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable
unto men.<a id="kjv-titus-3-8"></a><sup>8</sup>

But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.<a id="kjv-titus-3-9"></a><sup>9</sup>

A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
reject;<a id="kjv-titus-3-10"></a><sup>10</sup> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth,
being condemned of himself.<a id="kjv-titus-3-11"></a><sup>11</sup>

When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to
come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.<a id="kjv-titus-3-12"></a><sup>12</sup>

Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently,
that nothing be wanting unto them.<a id="kjv-titus-3-13"></a><sup>13</sup>

And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary
uses, that they be not unfruitful.<a id="kjv-titus-3-14"></a><sup>14</sup>

All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the
faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.<a id="kjv-titus-3-15"></a><sup>15</sup>
