0:00
you've attracted a lot of attention among the kind of the Orthob bro kind of
0:05
crowd. Uh I kind of wanted to know what it was about. So are you a priest in the Orthodox church?
0:10
Yes, I am. Well, I'm a true Orthodox Christian. So uh I am a priest. Yeah. So
0:16
you know basically we don't believe in accuminism etc. And I'm trying Why is Hold on. Can you give me just one
0:22
second? Yeah. So I I'm curious what is causing like this uproar if I if I may.
0:30
Yeah. [sighs] Uh okay. So I think so many people have said oh look
0:36
you should debate J D debate J D and things like that because I have put you don't like J D.
0:41
I'm not a fan. No. No. That's funny. And I have done a video uh
0:48
maybe just under a year ago I think it was on 10 reasons not to convert to the
0:54
Eastern Orthodox Church. I was actually I had not watched that yet, but I was actually going to review
0:59
that live and then I saw you were live. Oh, okay. Fair enough. [laughter]
1:05
So maybe that's where the upall came from was from that video and maybe in some other videos I've made. I've had
1:10
some chats I with Orthodox Kyle. He's a he's another Orthodox person. He's in. Yeah, I've not spoken to him much. I
1:18
barely actually, but um yeah, he's part of the same crowd. So, Right. Yeah. And in that conversation, I
1:26
think the big point that we were dealing with is how we're saved. And so, my perspective was say by grace
1:32
through faith, not by works that we do. Um, and Orthodox Kyle would say, "No, it
1:38
is based on, you know, works contribute at some sort in some ways to your entry
1:44
to heaven and you can't really know for sure you're going to heaven is his perspective." Okay? And because I make that a huge focus of
1:51
my channel, my ministry is I want people to understand how to be saved. I want people to go to heaven ultimately.
1:58
Okay. No, that that obviously that makes sense. Yeah. I I think that's really important.
2:04
Jesus said, "Don't rejoice the demons are subject to you in my name. Rejoice that your names are written in heaven." Yeah.
2:09
So having people know how to be saved. It's so important.
2:14
Yeah. And so then um I would say the Orthodox view maybe from your perspective, you said you're
2:20
true Orthodox. So you used to be Eastern Orthodox or you just No. No. Let let me explain. True Orthodox believe they are the Eastern
2:26
Orthodox. So from our perspective, like most of world orthodoxy, they're they're basically a humanist. they believe in in
2:33
interreligious synratis uh synratism so on and so forth. So um basically you
2:40
know because we consider accuminism a heresy and also I'm sure you're familiar with you know 20th century history with
2:47
the communists taking over they killed off millions of Orthodox Christians uh we kind of sympathize with the
2:54
Christians who were martyed as opposed to the ones who were taken over by the communists so on and so forth. So that
3:01
we believe that there's basically a worldwide sism right now and it bears out because there's true Orthodox in every Orthodox country. There's like a
3:07
hundred something parishes in the US and there's a there's a number of parishes
3:12
in Europe. Uh I I don't know. I assume you're in England. Um I'm in Australia.
3:18
Oh, in Australia. Oh, there's a lot in Australia now that I think about it because they have the they have Yeah,
3:23
they have a couple bishops there and so there's lots of the point is our beliefs are basically orthodoxy before 1924.
3:32
Okay. H interesting. So then what do you what is your view on how someone gets to
3:38
go to heaven? Um well I believe that they have to you know they have if they believe they have
3:44
to repent and they have to be baptized. Um then they live life in the church and
3:49
you know they receive the mysteries, they follow the commandments of God, they don't you know sin. Um you know the
3:58
basics um okay and then uh that's the easiest that's
4:04
okay. [snorts] I get what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. So to me that sounds quite a lot like based
4:11
on our performance. Then if it's based on me having to participate in all these different things, do these works, avoid
4:16
sin, get baptized, then well getting baptized I think is basic. I think we we agree on that, right?
4:22
Well, I think baptism is a great thing. 100% we should do that. I wouldn't hold to perspective that it's a necessary
4:28
thing for salvation, though. Now that's interesting. Um, you know,
4:33
it's I did. Have you ever heard of Scott Adams? Not sure if I know him. Name rings a
4:40
bell. I'm not sure though. Okay. He's a he's an American uh cartoonist who died uh today. He
4:46
actually died. And one of the things that happened uh in the past like week or so is that he began talking about his
4:52
death coming because he had cancer and he was dying, but he was a skeptic. And throughout his entire life, he was an
4:58
atheist. Um. Wow. So he died, but he put in in his,
5:04
you know, his death note that he wrote before he died. Um, he said, uh, well,
5:10
because of the number of Christians that are convinced I I'll be okay if I just believe in Jesus, Jesus, I believe in
5:17
you, and if you're not there, well, oh well. And uh I I obviously thought that
5:23
was ridiculous. I don't know how you feel, but it sounds like if it's that easy, I mean, shoot, even he made it.
5:29
Well, I don't know if that if what he was believing because if you just believe Jesus is real, like the demons
5:35
know that and they believe that. But that's he his exact words. I I feel bad. Let me
5:41
just get the man's words because I don't want to misquote him. But he basically said, "I believe on you as Lord and Savior, and if you're not there, oh
5:47
well." Something to that effect. I to me that doesn't sound like he's fully convinced, though, because like how the
5:52
Bible describes faith is that you're fully convinced that God will do what God promised to do. So
5:58
yeah, I'm not sure I'm not sure the state of his soul. I'm not sure what he was truly believing. But
6:04
let's say you have someone like him or even like someone who's even like the worst person you could ever imagine.
6:09
And on their deathbed, Yeah. And on their deathbed, they come to trust in Jesus that Jesus
6:15
took all their punishment. So they're resting in what Jesus did. I would say they're going to heaven.
6:21
I don't know that he even understood the idea of redemption from sin. [snorts] I'm not talking about I'm not talking
6:27
about that person. But I'm saying if say the worst person alive general Oh, you're talking if a person genuinely repents is [snorts] what
6:34
you're saying. So what I'm saying they come to the point where they realize I should be in hell, right? But Jesus took my
6:40
punishment. I'm now going to rely on what he's done alone to save me. Then I would say yeah, they're going to heaven
6:46
if they died. Even if they haven't got baptized, even if they haven't gone to church in their life, let's still go to
6:51
heaven. What do you think? Uh I think that that's possible. I often use the example of um I often use the
6:56
example of the Middle Eastern child who has a dream about Jesus, believes, says he believes to his parents and gets killed. I mean that's you know that to
7:03
that's a baptism of blood technically but the whole point is he would go to heaven. I have no doubt about that. Okay, but let's say not someone's not
7:09
martyed though. Let's just say someone that's dying of cancer or something, last moment of their life, they believe
7:14
genuinely in Christ that he paid for their sin. Would they be saved? I would have to say I'm not sure. Uh
7:20
because to me I would say I would leave that one up to God because uh if he confessed it
7:26
I would say that that's important and then let's say he confessed it he realized it and he died. That act I
7:31
think has some value to God obviously. So I think that that's what about the thief on the cross though right? Isn't he a perfect example of
7:37
someone on his deathbed so to speak and coming to trust in Jesus and Jesus says today you'll be with me in paradise.
7:43
Hold on one second. We cannot hear him. Oh okay. They're they're saying they
7:49
Okay. Hold on. This is tricky because people are saying that I you can't hear you. But what you're saying about the thief of the cross on the cross, that's
7:55
a valid example, but he's literally right next to our Lord. So it's not like
8:01
most of these people are that that the point is that that was a very unique
8:06
circumstance. I think you'd agree. Okay. But I don't know if it's about the location because it's just that he came
8:12
to rely on Christ to save him, right? He's relying on Jesus as his as his
8:17
savior. And so therefore, whether you're physically located next to Jesus or whether you're thousands of miles away
8:23
from him, if you put your trust in Jesus, you'd be saved. Well, I would assume that on the in the
8:29
normal circumstance, if that was true, if like let's say your argument is completely true that um the thief on the
8:36
cross, he was saved, it didn't distance didn't matter. Okay.
8:41
The next question would be then why were the apostles baptizing people at all?
8:46
Yeah. Because baptism is a good thing. It's a I'd say a public declaration of
8:52
somebody's faith. But just like why does Jesus give commands if those are
8:57
commands are not required for salvation? Well, because they're things that we ought to do to as as Christians, we
9:04
should live them out, but he just doesn't make them requirements. So, they're very important to do. Just don't
9:10
say I'm going to heaven on the basis of those things. So, um, you know, it's
9:15
like I could I could say to or let's say a parent said to their child, "Look,
9:21
child, I want you to do this and this and this for you for me today." Um, now doing those things for the parent
9:28
doesn't make the child part of the family. They're already part of the family, but because they're a child and
9:35
they respect their parents, they want to do the things that have been asked of them. And so doing the things like baptism and other commands that Jesus
9:41
gives are what we do because we're part of God's family, but they're not the thing that actually makes us a child of
9:47
God. Well, okay. First off, I want to mention that uh because I was told that people
9:52
on my chat couldn't hear you. I'm switching to this uh to the Streamyard uh screen, so hopefully that doesn't
9:57
offend or anything. But uh what I would say is this. Um, while one can make the
10:03
argument that families have rules and that obviously that doesn't uh what's
10:08
the word I'm looking for? Um, remove them from the family if they're disobedient for example,
10:15
um, the family tie isn't broken. What I'm saying is that um, ultimately
10:21
although the church is I mean the church is like a family, it's it's a body.
10:26
It's, you know, it's supposed to represent the body of Christ on earth. Um I would say that um there are things
10:33
that can separate people from the family like we you I'm sure you know the par
10:38
the parable of the prodigal son um obviously you know the son left and he
10:45
was welcomed back and that that's a perfect example again of repentance and like the thief on the cross he repented
10:51
etc. But the circumstances in the church in the early church we find in the scriptures seem to indicate that baptism
10:58
was required. Like in other words, I'm not saying that um there aren't cases
11:04
where it isn't. What I'm saying is that the general norm is repent and be baptized for the remission of sins. I I
11:10
I I hope we agree on that. No, I'm not sure if that's seems to be even the general norm. Like all
11:16
throughout, not only not not only have we seen the thief on the cross example where he didn't require baptism, was just saved on the basis of putting his
11:23
trust in Jesus, even Luke 7 earlier on, Jesus says to her, "Your sins are
11:29
forgiven." Okay? And then he says to her, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace." So on the basis
11:36
of faith, she was saved. Well, I mean, on the basis of faith, she
11:42
was healed. Because the woman with the issue of blood, it wasn't necess, it wasn't even a salvation issue. She was
11:48
just trying to Your sins are forgiven. Your sins are forgiven. This is salvation. Yeah.
11:53
Right. But now what h how about the blind man? Sure. But let's before in this example,
11:58
it's about your sins are forgiven and therefore your faith is saved. You go in peace.
12:04
Uh yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, as I said, let's let's assume that what we're assuming now, however, I will say is
12:10
we're assuming that this woman was saved just like every other member of the church who was baptized, etc.
12:15
Um, and the blind man, I assume you're using the same kind, you would use the same argument because he says the same
12:21
thing. Your sins are forgiven. Um, well, in you're talking about the paralytic that
12:27
the paralytic, you're right. Sorry. Yeah. In the paralytic in Matthew chapter 9, yeah, we see that
12:33
thing and the rabbis say, you know, Jesus when when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart,
12:39
my son, your sins are forgiven." So, we got three instances so far on the basis of faith, people's sins were forgiven.
12:47
Welcome, Father Bonafice. Father Bonafice Bened, um, Father Bonafice is
12:53
here. I don't know if I can get him. I don't know if you wanted to talk to him. Yeah, I'm sure he has a point he wants
12:58
to make, but okay. But so, so three examples so far, and I think this is the consistent
13:04
teaching of scripture. Even Jesus in John 6:47, Jesus says, "Truly, truly, I
13:09
say to you, whoever believes has eternal life." So if somebody believes, then
13:16
according to Jesus, they've got eternal life. What does he say right after that in John 6:53?
13:21
Yeah, we can talk about in a second, but okay, so whoever believes has eternal life. So if somebody believes but let's say
13:29
hasn't got baptized or hasn't taken part in the Eucharist, what do they still have according to Jesus here?
13:36
Uh what do you mean? Well, if Jesus says whoever believes has
13:41
eternal life, if somebody believes but hasn't taken part in the Eucharist or hasn't been baptized,
13:48
but what does it say? 53. Just wait. What do they still have? Based on verse 47, what do they still
13:53
have? Just based on verse 47 out of context, you would say they still not out of context.
13:59
Not out of context. If we if we if you go if you want to look at the context, this is consistently what Jesus said
14:04
earlier on even, right? But the if we I'm pointing Yeah. Read it. Read. I am the bread.
14:10
I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall not hunger. Whoever believes in me shall never thirst. So he's
14:15
emphasizing throughout this chapter also verse 40. But this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the
14:22
son and believes in him should have eternal life and I'll raise him up on the last day. So what have we seen so far is sufficient for someone to have
14:29
eternal life? No, because doesn't what does he say about eating his flesh and eating his
14:34
and drinking his blood? Okay. But I'm saying before we go to 53, I'm I'm happy to deal with 53, but I'm saying based on
14:39
the context of 35, 40, 47, the verses
14:45
we've read, what does he say is sufficient to have eternal life? Well, if you're just using those verses
14:51
in isolation, then it would be not in isolation. The context, this is the you can read, I'll let you read the context in your own time, but I'm just
14:56
saying he's made explicit statements in these chap in this chapter about how to have eternal life. Yes. And he mentions
15:02
it's based on believing. Correct. Yeah. But he also says, "I am the bread of life."
15:07
Yeah. Yeah. Which we don't think he's a loaf of bread. We don't actually think he's just popped down out of heaven as a loaf of bread as a human being.
15:14
No, but that's that's what he means. And when they asked him, wait, that doesn't sound right, he would he doubled down on
15:19
it. Right. So, if we both believe that he is not a literal loaf of bread, then we
15:25
both agree that he's speaking in some sort of figure of speech. Right. And my point is he wasn't because
15:30
if we go to John 53, he hold So you're saying he's not speaking in
15:36
any figure of speech at this point. Do you actually think he's a loaf of bread? That's what the people that's why the people demanded clarification and when
15:42
he doubled down, they left. Just wait. So you actually think Jesus is not a human being, but he's just a loaf of bread.
15:48
No, I think Jesus is a is the son of God and is can manifest in any way he wants.
15:53
So then is he speaking literally when he says he's bread? Is he made of yeast and
15:59
flour, water? Technically, actually, most the It's
16:06
funny that you say that. It didn't occur to me, but in fact, he was put in the oven. He's put in the
16:11
oven and then like, so those three ingredients, is he unleavened bread? Like, come on. Like, you know, clearly he's not speaking
16:17
literally. He's speaking in a figure of speech here. Part of the reason that that John is interesting is because
16:23
there is no Eucharistic narrative except this one in at all. This is not about the Eucharist.
16:29
Well, I think I might disagree on that one. Well, in the context, it's not about the it's not about like we're having the
16:35
last supper and so like here's the instructions like in Matthew and the other gospels, he talks about instructions for the Lord's supper. But
16:41
but this doesn't a crowd of unbelievers, right? But this is why that this one is really interesting cuz if you look at
16:48
the Greek, you know, when he says, you know, I'm the bread of life and whoever I mean, you if you could put it up cuz I
16:54
don't verse 53. So So this this remember the Jews here, which are a bunch of unbelieving Jews.
17:01
Yeah. Right. He's already said they're unbelievers. They're not understanding him. Right. And so they say, "How can this man give
17:08
us his flesh to eat?" Mhm. Jesus. So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the
17:13
flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." Now, you know what's really interesting about this particular thing? He switches
17:19
in 54. Like it's it reads the same in English in 53 and 54, but in 54, he
17:26
actually switches to the verb for animal eating, which is if you you must munch on my flesh. So he makes it explicit
17:33
that like he he Do you realize Do you realize you're actually aligning yourself with the unbelieving Jews at this point? Because
17:40
the unbelieving Jews are thinking what? So I've got to take a bite of his arm and eat his flesh. That's weird. You're
17:46
actually lining yourself with with with the unbelieving Jews. If you're thinking Jesus is not speaking in any sort of
17:52
figure of speech, if you're thinking that what the these Jewish people should have done, they should have should have taken a
17:58
piece of his ear off and started reading it. No, you see, but this is the point of the other institution narratives is
18:03
that the the early Christians, and I don't know if you know this, but many of the early Christians in the first couple of centuries were arrested and martyed
18:11
for cannibalism, even though they were actually just doing the Eucharist.
18:16
Well, they were accused of being cannibals. Yeah. If you got accused, you're going to die.
18:22
Yeah. Sure. Sure. Because they just misunderstood. Maybe the people misunderstood the line that Jesus made.
18:27
This is my body. This is my blood. We are not actual cannibals. No, but human flesh.
18:34
I understand that. But the point I'm trying to make is that Christians at the time were being accused of that because
18:39
they were saying things like they were eating the flesh and drinking the blood of Christ and they were referring to the
18:45
Eucharist and non-believers. No, maybe not. The point is, I mean, do you
18:51
believe that Christ could bread and wine? But do you think that the Jewish like if let's say they decided to say,
18:58
"Okay, all right, Jesus. I'm going to go take a bite of your your fingers and they start chopping off some fingers of
19:04
Jesus, would they be then would they actually be doing what Jesus is wanting them to
19:10
do at that point?" No, I I don't think so. All right, but hold up. But they're eating. They're doing animal eating even
19:15
as you mentioned. Here's my question. First off, if we believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God who came to the earth to save
19:22
sinners, if he is the second person of the Trinity, um then nothing happens
19:28
without his his uh what's the word I'm looking for? Without his permission. And so I don't believe, for example, that
19:35
theoretically that these Jews would start chopping up Jesus's fingers. Realistically, he knew what he was
19:40
saying. What did Jesus want them to do? Did Jesus at this point in time want them to
19:45
do that? Uh I think that at that point the reason he did that was to literally
19:51
thresh off people who were not truly believing in him. Ah there we go. So there were a bunch of unbelie I agree a bunch of unbelievers
19:58
and they were misunderstanding him. But you know who wasn't misunderstanding was Peter for example.
20:04
Well it says right right it says the disciples right after if you just scroll right after when they left you'll see it says you know
20:09
to whom to whom should we go? You have the word you want to go away. That's my point. Yeah. So you have the words of eternal
20:16
life and we have believed and have come to know that you are the holy one of God. So if Peter has come to believe,
20:22
what does he have according to Jesus? Does he still have eternal life? Well, I would say that he is well, yeah,
20:28
I believe he obviously has eternal life. But therefore, if Peter has eternal
20:33
life, therefore, what Jesus meant in 53 that unless you eat the flesh of the son of
20:39
man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. If you agree Peter has eternal life because he's believed and Peter hasn't taken part in the Eucharist
20:45
at this point. Therefore, 53 mustn't be talking about the Eucharist. It must be a figure of
20:50
speech referring to believing in him. You believe unless you believe in him, you've come to consume him.
20:56
Unless it's prophetic. Let us say, for example, and humor me here if you will, that um the apostles did not understand
21:03
what Jesus was talking about, but had faith that he would explain it to them later. I mean, there is that possibility
21:11
that they just they're like, "This is weird, but okay." I don't just the context doesn't seem to
21:17
be instructions for the Lord's supper. He seemed the whole sermon is about believing in him, believing in him. And
21:22
then he's giving a figure of speech. He's not literally bread that came down. He's a human, but he's our sustenance.
21:28
And so, if the metaphor is bread, eating this metaphorical bread mustn't be then actually eating literal bread or literal
21:34
human flesh. It would be to believe in him. Even verse 63 mentions it. That's my point.
21:40
Spirit who gives life. The flesh is no help at all. The words that I've spoken to you are spirit and life.
21:47
Yeah. So clearly speaking spiritual truths here, not physical literal take a bite
21:52
of his arm. See I but that's my point is that there is a theological truth being expressed
21:57
here that is expressed more graphically in the synoptic gospels. So that's my my point is it's not I'm not it's not
22:04
either or. It's and together. I like I don't think the synoptics teach that you're literally eating him when he says
22:10
this is my body. This is my blood. Do this in remembrance of me. I I can agree this is my body. This is my blood. But
22:16
in what sense? In a sense that I'm actually taking a bite of Jesus or in a sense of this
22:22
bread points me to Jesus. And that's why it's still called bread afterwards in
22:27
a good um father my co-host Father Bonafice on on our channel asked what what um what church do you belong to?
22:35
I go to a Presbyterian church myself. Okay. He's he's a Yeah, father. Oh,
22:41
okay. He asked which one? Uh I live in Australia, so it's not going to be what the US if you think of
22:47
US ones, they're different denominations. Yeah. Um he said he knows Presbyterian churches
22:53
and I mean father if you want to click his streaming or like maybe we can bring you on too. I I don't know. Can you have more than one one person on?
23:01
Um possibly. But I I'm I am enjoying this chat with you because it might get too chaotic if there's more like it just
23:07
gets chaotic. I understand. I understand. Yeah. So I just want to just check. So we've seen that.
23:14
Yeah. So I think the Eucharist subject I personally would say yes. We it points me to Jesus. I do it in remembrance of
23:19
him. So therefore, it mustn't actually be Jesus that I'm eating because otherwise I wouldn't do it in remembrance of him.
23:25
Do you understand what they do you understand the Greek on the term do it in remembrance that the anomises it's a
23:31
in other words he's actually it's a it's saying basically that that a perpetual memorial be set up for me. Um it is not
23:38
a typical remebrance. It's a it's a it's memorial. It's reminding me of Jesus. I proclaim the
23:44
Lord's death until he comes by celebrating the Eucharist. Welcome reader John. Right. And also
23:52
uh in under your in your church or at least in the Eastern Orthodox Church, I'm curious in your church, do you have
23:57
to fast before taking the Eucharist from like maybe the night before?
24:03
Hold on. I'm getting Okay, I'm getting like double I'm hearing like both voices
24:08
from everyone. Uh first off, um Okay. Yeah, I understood Father Bonafice pointing out that he first said, "This
24:14
is my body. This is my blood. Do this in remembrance of me." What did you just ask me? So I was just asking in your
24:20
church I'm just curious do you have to fast before taking the Eucharist from the night the night before? Yes.
24:25
Okay. So no food or water since the night before. Is that right? Uh generally I mean there are people who
24:30
are sick there are exceptions you know so but that's the basic rule cuz when I see in 1 Corinthians 11 when
24:36
Paul gives the instructions for how to do the Lord's supper he mentions [clears throat] that if anyone is hungry
24:41
make sure you eat beforehand at home so that you're not coming together for
24:46
judgment. Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. Well, uh, yes, but I mean, you know, that's that's a given that we do
24:54
do that. You know, we we want to eat before that because that fast is basically the same. You're not supposed to. Hold up. Hold
25:00
up. You're you're you're going to be hungry. If you wake up and you haven't been able to eat since the night before
25:06
you go to church, you're going to be hungry while the the service is on. No, not if not in the first century. The
25:14
assumption would be, you know, basically just eat the night before and you'll be fine when you wake up and receive communion and then you can eat after.
25:20
No, but even today I speak to Orthodox even, you know, particularly Orthodox people and they're like, "Yeah, I'm
25:26
hungry. I'm starving. When I go to the Eucharist, I Okay, they did it wrong. They they Yeah. And they did that.
25:32
No, just physically. Physically, you're going to be hungry. If you haven't eaten breakfast in the morning, you're probably going to be hungry."
25:38
Yeah. I So, the verse I'm thinking of is this. 1 Corinthians 11:33. So then, my brothers,
25:44
when you come together to eat, and the context is the Lord's supper, wait for one another. If anyone is hungry, let
25:51
him eat at home so that when you come together, it will not be for judgment.
25:56
So the point in the Corinthian church, some were like eating all the food at the Lord.
26:02
This is the agape. This is the agape meal we're talking about after the after the communion. But
26:07
well, this seems to either way same context as the Lord's supper, right? So he's like, "Don't come for the Lord's
26:13
supper basically to get food." Yeah, I know, right? You eat beforehand and then you
26:18
come with a full stomach and you eat the or you have the bread, you drink the cup
26:23
and so that you do it decently than in order and no one's going to be tempted to eat more than another person,
26:30
right? So to me that just sounds like a tradition that that church your church has that would contradict the the
26:37
instruction. I don't I don't think so at all. I mean we have to understand first off do you f do you understand let me ask you a
26:43
question in your church it's at our experience do you fast at all like regular I'd say fasting is not a no our church
26:50
doesn't command fasting um but fasting is an optional thing that people can choose to do well I mean remember lord
26:59
okay well we before getting into the question of you know where you drive authority etc um I do want to ask
27:06
because if fasting is unne necessary then it makes it impossible to be rid of
27:12
certain types of demons because our lord said only yes because certain remember
27:17
this one can only be so when you say getting rid of demons you're saying like demons like possessing you
27:23
do believe in demons right yeah yeah I believe in demons but I don't think a Christian can be de I don't think a demon can could be living
27:29
inside of a Christian if you have a look at 2 Thessalonians 3:3 the Lord is faithful he will establish you and guard
27:36
you against the evil one So if I got the spirit in me, I got the I got go God God guarding me. I can't have a demon inside
27:43
of me. I got the spirit inside of me, the Holy Spirit. Yeah. I I was talking uh can we go to
27:49
Matthew 17:21? Yeah. But do you agree with this that the Lord guards people?
27:55
Um yeah, I I do. But it but we have to qualify it with our Lord's words as well.
28:00
Sure. It says here, well actually Matthew 17:21 is not in
28:06
the earliest manuscripts. It goes here. Oh, no. You're not doing what I just read that Wes Huff denied um the the
28:12
sinful woman in the Gospel of John. Is this a new thing now where we're like taking it's just not here. There is no
28:19
verse 21. It goes verse 20 and there's no verse 21. Look, where's verse 21?
28:24
Okay, it's not there. Let me just I'm going to be because it's
28:29
not it's not in the earliest manuscripts. Okay, give me just a second.
28:37
What version of the scriptures do you use? Uh, this is the ESV.
28:42
Oh, okay. Um, okay. Yeah, it's my that's modern stuff. Uh, okay. I realize that
28:48
there are It's just based on what we've discovered. It's just what the manuscripts we've discovered of the Bible. It's a minority text, but yeah, it's
28:55
it's based on a modern scholarship rejecting a lot of verses because Matthew Matthew
29:01
It's not really that case. It's not the case. Just like the translations, even like the KJV, if you want to go to that, the KJV rejects or t has taken out
29:09
certain sentences and verses or at least phrases that were in prior English
29:15
manuscript uh English translations. In the in the 1900 KJV, Matthew 17:21
29:20
reads, "How be it?" Yeah, I'm not talking about that. I'm saying I'm saying in the KJV, there are other phrases the KJV has taken out. So,
29:25
every translation has to work on what manuscripts we have at the time. Now for
29:31
400 years ago they had some manuscripts. They didn't have as many manuscripts as we've discovered today. So I would rather what Matthew actually
29:37
wrote than something which got added in by later on.
29:42
I I I mean what is first off what is your name? I I don't know your My name's Ryan. Ryan, I I I I want to
29:50
urge this and I want to kind of stick on this point because um you know, as I
29:55
mentioned that minority text says, how be it this this kind of does not go out
30:00
by prayer and fasting. This is not I mean when we're talking about the words of Jesus and in terms of how we apply
30:06
them in our lives, we have to be very careful and I I feel like it's if we
30:13
just carelessly say this didn't happen like so would it be wrong for someone to add in something which Jesus never said.
30:19
I don't believe that they added in something which Jesus How would you know? How would you know that they didn't? I have faith.
30:26
That's a blind that's like Muslim saying trust in Muhammad. Why faith in Muhammad? That's not a good reason.
30:33
Yeah. I have faith in in [laughter] Christ and his church. I mean, you're that argument. Are you are we going back to the whole Luther taking out the book
30:39
of James and stuff like that? I mean, that's interesting, right? No. No. Instead, we got to go to what
30:46
manuscripts have we've got. I want to go I want to see what Jesus said. I don't want what someone else said that Jesus
30:51
said. I want to go what as in like what someone like 500 or like even you're assuming that Jesus didn't say that.
30:59
Well, that's my point is that I'm not going to assert that he did say it unless I have sufficient evidence to say that he did say it. But either way,
31:05
let's say let's say for for the sake of argument. You kind of just did. Um let's say for the sake of argument, um
31:12
he said that one. What is it? Yeah. How be it this kind goeth not out but by
31:18
prayer and fasting. Okay. So then this is not talking about prayer um demons inside of Christians.
31:26
No believers. Point is the church loses without prayer and fasting the ability to stop these demons.
31:33
No, but okay. But do you think a Christian, someone who is put their trust in Jesus can have a demon
31:41
possessing them or No, no, no, no. First off, I I don't believe that. No, no, no. Demons do not
31:47
enter Christians except for those who fall and let them, you know, and usually
31:52
they enter they enter non-Christians and everyone else. Yeah. Right. There's a so the point is
31:58
but what I'm saying is that if the corporate body is the church loses assuming this is true they lose
32:05
that power to stop a demon because this specific kind requires that level of
32:12
prayer and fasting that people don't have but that is having to rely on something which is again not in the oldest copies
32:18
we have but beside that point yeah I mean that's an exugesus where you
32:24
don't have authority but more importantly I I'm just blown away that we we're taking the words of Jesus less
32:30
seriously. I mean, these have the church has held that these texts have
32:35
developed. Yeah. For thousand. I I I think you see when I encounter
32:42
uh Muslims, I encounter Mormons and other people, they claim to have some words of Jesus that are not found in the Bible either. They say that Jesus said
32:48
this and I'm not and therefore hold up. Therefore, just because they claim that Jesus said this, that doesn't mean Jesus
32:54
did. Wait a second. I want you to take keep in mind the gravity of what you're saying here. You're saying that the
33:00
church that preserved the scriptures for centuries, the same scriptures you're holding in at least a somewhat editing
33:07
form and you're putting them at the same level as Muslims with forgeries. I'm not
33:13
putting the same I think you're made up. You're misunderstanding my if that's what you thought that you misunderstood
33:19
what I'm saying. I'm saying just because someone claims Jesus said something doesn't necessarily mean that he did.
33:25
That's my point. We have to assume the church is true. [sighs] Well, I think it depends what you mean
33:31
by the church. You're talking about an institution because I would say for example maybe the the translation that was common
33:37
throughout the Middle Ages was was the Latin Vulgate. Say that again. I miss that. There was the translation that was
33:44
common for throughout the Middle Ages since you know about 500 or so was the
33:49
Latin Vulgate in the west. Now the Latin Vulgate has some pretty bad errors in its translation.
33:55
Uh yeah, I'm aware of that. Yeah, there's different. So therefore, just and so the church which had accepted this Latin Vulgate
34:02
translation for so long approved of a translation which had some terrible errors in it. Terrible. you're
34:08
forgetting that the Orthodox used the Greek, not the Latin. Um, but more
34:13
importantly, I understand. But do you see my point though is that would you say that's the church though? Like if if you cuz you
34:19
wouldn't say the church split since what only 10 1050, right? Yeah. So therefore,
34:25
you would have to say that when the church had approved of using the Latin Vulgate, which they did,
34:31
you'd have to say Yeah, they did. And you'd have to say then the church has got that wrong in approving that as um a
34:36
good translation to use. Except and I'm not a big I'm not a big defender of Roman Catholicism here. I
34:42
think they're heretics etc. But I would argue that earlier versions of the Vulgate um are actually better than the
34:48
Clementine. The Clementine version of the Vulgate was like in 1500 or something riddled with errors. They had
34:54
to fix it a dozen times. Um it was a personal papal translation but it was not based on the rest of the Vulgate. It
35:01
was not based on the older Vulgate scripts. I would say yeah I would say but even Jerome but even but even Jerome
35:07
though he translated the Greek word metaninoia as uh do penance
35:14
right well right from the beginning which was not which is an incorrect translation of
35:19
what metaninoia means. It doesn't mean do penance. No well it means transformation and that was from the beginning. That was that was the be that was right from
35:26
the beginning when Jerome translated. Sorry, but if we can be fair on this because by meaning do penance um the meaning is
35:33
functionally the same because doing penance is an act of repentance. It's an act of turning around. Metaninoia
35:39
literally does mean turning around. I think it would be a change of mind. A
35:45
change of mind that happens and I think it does produce a fruit of repentance will be which will be that change of behavior
35:50
and maybe prayers that will be made. But that's a the fruit of repentance. You don't conflate the fruit of something with the thing itself.
35:57
Now I Father Bonafice has a question. Uh what does fornowledge mean in um Romans
36:03
chapter 8 2029? Okay, that's that's random. That's
36:08
just I know I'm like I'm [laughter] I'm I'm but because I would I I think it's Yeah.
36:15
God knowing people before they even existed before the foundation of the world. He knows them and what he does
36:20
with those particular individuals. It says he predestines to be conformed to the image of his son that they might be the but that Jesus might be the
36:26
firstborn among many brothers and then he for those particular people he um he
36:31
calls them he justifies them and he glorifies them as it says in verse 30. But I want to ask you this go back to
36:36
the topic of we've seen numerous examples of salvation of like how okay say by faith
36:41
say by faith the message Jesus taught was believe you have eternal life. uh we
36:47
see Paul himself was asked the question sers what must I do to be saved and Paul
36:53
and Silas respond by saying believe in the Lord Jesus and you'll be saved so
36:59
this seems to be the way that someone receives salvation is just to believe in
37:04
Christ to trust in him what do you think about that well I mean first off what I would say
37:09
is that um it's not a singular act of belief in the cases that we presented
37:15
those were very unique context. Um, you can't divide I can't the way I see it is
37:21
you can't divide the scriptures. You can't divide Christ from the church. If we look at
37:27
Exactly. You keep getting interrupted like I can't because maybe if you're the other person can let you finish speaking.
37:34
Yeah. Here's what I would say is let's go to Acts uh 2:38. Okay. But hold up. So just dealing with
37:40
the verse that's on the screen. Uh-huh. Was Paul incorrect when he said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will
37:46
be saved." No, he was not contextual he was not contextually incorrect at all. And what
37:51
happened? As soon as they spoke the word uh to them, they baptized them.
37:57
So then was he saved as soon as he believed in the Lord Jesus? Uh it I I
38:04
[clears throat] do not know because the mystery of unity between God and his people is one that
38:10
is based in order not chaos. And my point is if if in every case we find
38:17
with Paul like right here on your screen at the bottom line it says and he was baptized at once.
38:23
Yeah. That's the reason. So so that's my point. And when we go to Acts, but notice notice he doesn't say believe
38:30
um is not sufficient to be saved and you also got to get baptized too. He just says believe in the Lord Jesus and
38:35
you'll be saved. And afterwards he goes gets baptized. Yeah, that's what happens. We do we do acts of obedience
38:41
once we're saved but not as a basis of being saved. But you said you said did you say that we can't be sure if we're
38:47
saved? Is that what your comment said? Like you can't be it's a mystery. So, I'm just going to So, so if somebody
38:54
believes in Christ, can they be sure that they're saved? Uh, if they follow him correctly. Yeah.
39:01
No, no, but that's an extra thing. I'm saying if they listen to Paul here, they believe in the Lord Jesus, they put
39:06
their trust in what Jesus has done to save them, would they be saved before they do any acts of obedience like
39:11
following and baptism and commands? He was baptized at once. He was it was done right then.
39:18
Okay. But I'm just asking you. It doesn't say that was an extra thing he needed to do. But that is a result. Once
39:24
someone gets saved, they do that. But my question for you is if somebody just hears the word of Paul, let's say
39:29
they're reading scripture right now, they believe in the Lord Jesus. Christ paid for their sin on the cross,
39:35
would they be saved at that very moment in time? Um I I don't know. It's goes It goes
39:42
It's up to God. God reads the heart of man. Yeah. This is my this is my point is
39:48
that that's it's the Scott Adams thing again like you know he did say he accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior sort
39:54
of you know I mean does it count you know I and that's someone can profess to believe is
40:00
different to actually believing so I'm not just talking about someone saying oh yeah I would just say I believe someone who genuinely in their heart believes in
40:06
the Lord Jesus Christ that Christ paid for all their sin I think they can know they're saved
40:12
otherwise it makes this sentence meaningless Well, and do you think you're saved? Maybe ask
40:18
you. Do you think you're saved right now? Well, I'll answer that when we deal with Acts, you know, chapter two, if we could,
40:23
because to me it sounds like you can't really know. You'd say it's a mystery under your view? No.
40:29
So, would you say you're 100% sure you're going to heaven? Um, I can't say that, but that's not based on Christ. That's based on me
40:36
because I can still fall away. So, but if Christ paid for all my sins,
40:41
past, present, even future ones, how could I be sent to hell if he's paid the price for me? Because you Well, in people can reject
40:49
Christ after they've accepted them him, unfortunately. And people can apostatize.
40:54
And that's well, I would say God sustains us. It says in Jude 1 that he we're kept for Jesus Christ. So, he keeps us. Like if
41:01
we go back to John chapter 6 and we go back to um you know around past 53 where
41:07
you know he mentions he says to you know they say you know well Lord you there's
41:12
a yeah this is a hard saying but you know we have uh the reward you know let's uh let's see here
41:19
what do you want go can you scroll up a little um yeah and so you see okay go down a
41:27
little there uh Ryan uh 59 so when You know, this is a hard saying. Who can listen to it? Scroll a little
41:33
more. They walked away. But listen to this. Yeah. But keep going. But this is where
41:38
it gets interesting. Uh if you go, you see how it's uh where is it?
41:45
Okay. Continue a little more. Okay. And you they say of course now
41:50
look at this. Go a little bit more. Um Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Almost. Now just
41:58
scroll a little bit down. Okay. You the 12 and yet one of you is a
42:04
devil. That one of you is a devil. Exactly. So like even though even though these were the foretold servants of God, he knew right
42:11
off the bat one of them was going to turn on him and described as a son of destruction.
42:17
John 17 he calls him that. But that doesn't he was he chose those
42:22
people to be his disciples and he knew from the beginning that Judas would betray him. That doesn't mean that Judas
42:28
was saved at one stage like Judas was saved and then he lost it. No, Judas was never truly a believer. In fact, if you
42:35
go through John's gospel, he speaks about Judas again in I think John chapter 12
42:41
when he speaks about how um Judas says why was this ointment not
42:46
sold for 300, right? He was complaining about the a kind act that Mary did. And he says he said this not because he
42:53
cared about the poor but because he was a thief and having charge of the money bag he used to help himself to what was
42:58
put into it. So we see Judas's character throughout um the gospels here. But the
43:04
point is uh with Judas he wasn't genuinely a believer who lost it. He
43:09
just was professing to believe. There are many people who profess who give up. like he said here, there are some of you
43:14
who do not believe because Jesus knew from the beginning um who was who would believe in him and
43:20
who would betray him and that's why he said this is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him
43:26
by the father. So you can only come to God if God grants that you come to him anyway. But if God does grant you to
43:31
come to him, he gives us the promise in uh verse 37, all that the father gives
43:38
me will come to me and whoever comes to me, I will never cast out. He's never
43:43
going to cast us out. Yeah. But like the point is like the pro like the prodigal,
43:50
you know, he will never cast you out of the family, but that doesn't mean you can't walk out. And so that means we're
43:55
stronger than God. Are we stronger than God? Judas was never part of it. It never says that Judas had been drawn to
44:03
faith and he was saved or anything like that. It just describes him as physically following after Jesus, but not that he was genuinely saved. Or even
44:09
this one, no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and I will raise him up on the last day.
44:16
There's no possibility here. If you're drawn by the father, you're going to be raised up on the last day.
44:21
or even as Paul says in Romans 8:30, if you're justified, you're also glorified. I mean, that kind of goes back to Romans
44:27
8:28, but we still Yeah. I mean, I've got again multiple
44:34
[snorts] people talking. So, it's this is this is very unprecedented, but for me, so this is new,
44:39
right? Right. I I I really do want you to end up in heaven, right? And I want everyone to go to heaven. That's my aim in for this
44:45
ministry. So if God asked you the question about why he you think you
44:51
should be led into heaven, what would you say to him? Uh I would say, "Lord have mercy on me a sinner." What happened? Uh hold on. Hold
44:58
on. Yeah, that I would honestly I would I would repent. I would, you know, ask for
45:03
God's mercy because there are no there are no works that can justify me. Um
45:09
this is And why do So do you think you will get God's mercy or you're not sure at this point? Come again? I didn't hear what you said.
45:15
So, will you will you get God's mercy or will you not? I've got two people.
45:21
If maybe can you maybe disconnect from the other call or something just so that you can we can focus because this is a really good conversation.
45:28
Yeah. I mean, uh I mean, Father Bonafice, uh I'm trying to figure out what to do here cuz
45:35
maybe if you can be silent for a while and then you can you guys can chat amongst each other afterwards, but just Well, okay. Well, he he had a question
45:41
for you. Well, just ask. But ju just wait. Just wait. I just cuz I this is a key point is that so you said God be merciful to me a sinner.
45:48
Yeah. So linking up with the parable in Luke 18. Yeah. And the that man went home justified.
45:54
But notice that man is not saying that on judgment day. That man is saying it now. God be
45:59
merciful to me a sinner. So my question is though, why on judgment day should he let you into
46:06
heaven as opposed to all the people who are going to hell?
46:11
Yeah, you could you could do that, father. Um, uh, that's a that's an interesting question, but I don't think that I'm more worthy than those people.
46:19
Like, you know, the point is, um, we have, you know, faith in our
46:26
Lord's promise to us. We work because, not because it's going to make any
46:32
difference, but because we're commanded to live out the commandments. We love God. We're taught to love God.
46:39
That's the whole point. if we love that. But you're making those things a necessary thing for salvation though,
46:45
right? Well, I'm not I'm not How is it How am I making it a necessary thing? Well, do you think that they are? Do you
46:50
think that those things are We've talked about you said earlier on following him, obeying him, getting baptized, all those
46:56
extra things are things for salvation. Well, when when uh the rich man asks our
47:02
Lord, "What must I do to be saved?" Did he just say, "Believe in me?" or did he go deeper?
47:07
He gave him the law. He didn't give him the gospel. They gave him the law. Why? Because the law exposes our
47:12
sinfulness. It was to expose that man's pride and to show him how bad he was.
47:18
The law doesn't justify you. Just brings a knowledge of sin. Well, I mean, he didn't he didn't he didn't once give the go the gospel message to that to
47:25
that rich young. He didn't want it. He did. From what I say, he went away
47:30
sorrowful. I thought he repented. I could have sworn that maybe Matthew 19. Matthew 19 and in Mark 10,
47:36
the parallel account, we don't see him. We see him going away sorrowful because he had great Yeah. Because he was he had
47:42
How can you know? Yeah. So, how can anyone go to heaven basically and he said with with man it's impossible with
47:48
God all things. Well, how can how can any Yeah, that was the the rich man. But that's the point
47:53
that even though it would be harder than for him to get harder for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich
47:59
man to enter the kingdom of heaven, it's still possible. And so I I hope
48:05
that What do you mean? Hold on. Isn't the point to show that a camel cannot go through the eye of a needle? Like that's
48:11
impossible. A needle is a little thing, the hole that's on the end of a a needle. You can't get fit a camel
48:16
through that, right? And that's why the disciples explain or have the expression
48:22
Jesus well then who can be saved? The point is obviously camels can't go through needles and Jesus saying rich
48:29
man can't go to heaven. But he doesn't say that they can't go to he says with even though it's it possible.
48:37
Exactly. That's my point. So am I saying rich men can't go to heaven based on their richness or anything about them.
48:42
It's got to be by God. It's got to be based on what God does, not based on what that's the point he's making there.
48:48
So it's impossible for man to get to heaven based on what they do. It's only through what God does that gets them to
48:53
heaven. So are you relying on what God has done for you on the cross to get you
48:59
to heaven? I believe so. I'm that is what we pray every morning. I mean, I don't know if
49:05
you're you probably aren't a big fan of I don't know how it works in Presbyterianism, but like
49:11
uh you know, prayers that are uh for lack of a better word uh written down,
49:18
right? Yeah. Okay. Written out prayer books. Yeah. I don't think they're bad. I think they could be useful. Um I've got this is one for This
49:24
is actually one that's read every morning. It's a morning prayer, if I may. Um, and I just, you know, there's a
49:31
lot of them. But just before you read the prayer though, I want to ask you though. Yeah. Okay. So, you said you are relying on
49:36
what Jesus did? Yeah. So, did Jesus take the punishment for all the sins that you've done?
49:41
Of course. That's the, you know, the point is Yeah. Go ahead. So then, how much punishment is left for
49:48
you to still get in hell? Oh, yeah. Hold on. I I will answer that
49:54
in just a second. Give me a moment. Uh my answer would be um in that particular
49:59
case that um it's not about the sins that you've been you know forgiven from
50:06
etc. It's actually about um it's about the sins we commit now cuz they're they
50:12
become even more heavy and more vile. Um father hasn't you said Jesus took 100% of that
50:19
right? So he took 100% of the punishment we deserve for all of our sins which would include not just the ones we do in
50:24
the past but it would include the ones we do today or tomorrow in the future right? Yeah. So then if he's taken all that
50:30
punishment how much punishment is left for you to still get depends on how much evil I mean that's
50:35
the point. He's taken all the punishment past, present and future but we are still operating in past, present and
50:41
future which means we are still sinning like there's paid for. So, how could there be any punishment left for you if he's already
50:48
paid for even the sin you do tomorrow? Because of the fact that God doesn't just forgive sins without granting us a
50:56
a chance of repentance. If we were just given a blank check to sin, um then what
51:03
would happen would be effectively what happens and we've seen this these effects on people. People become less um
51:11
they become worse, they become less Christian. Uh we've seen it many times. To the contrary, to the contrary, the
51:16
grace of God does not make us sin more. It makes us sin less because we're grateful to God for his amazing
51:21
sacrifice. So even though I know that my sins will not send me to hell, even my
51:27
future sins, they're not going to send me to hell because Jesus paid for them. But notice for me, I'm relying on what
51:33
Jesus did alone to get me to heaven. If you're depending upon your confessing of sins and your avoiding of sins to get
51:41
you to heaven, do you see how you're not actually depending entirely on what Jesus did to
51:47
get you to heaven? If you don't mind, can I read the prayer? You tell me what's wrong with it. I will let you tell me.
51:52
Do Do you see Do you see how you're not depending entirely on Jesus, though? Yeah, I No, but I I understand what you're saying, but I want to express
51:59
what we do. So, you I want you to analyze it and tell me what's wrong with it. How long is this prayer, by the way? Uh
52:05
it is approximately 10 lines long.
52:10
Okay. But I think this is the key point. So I'm happy for you to say that. And and you may affirm, look, he died on the
52:16
cross. He rose from the dead. You're going to affirm those true facts. The difference is what are you depending
52:22
upon to get you to heaven? Your prayers, your avoiding of sin, or the fact that he paid for all your sin on the cross.
52:28
It's always going to be I Go. You can read it. Go read it. Go read
52:34
it. Okay. My most merciful and mo most merciful and all merciful God, Lord Jesus Christ, in thy great love, thou
52:40
it's come down and become flesh in order to save all. Therefore, I pray, save me by thy grace. If thou should save me
52:46
because of my deeds, it would not be a gift, but rather a duty. But thou, my Christ, abundant in compassion and
52:52
inexpressable in mercy, has said, he who believes in me shall live and never see death. Thus, if faith in thee se saves
52:59
the desperate, save me also, for I believe that thou art my God and creator. May my faith replace my deeds,
53:05
oh my God, for thou will find no deeds to justify me. But may my faith be sufficient for all. May it answer for
53:12
me, may it justify me. May it make me a partaker of thine eternal glory. And may not Satan seize me, O word, and boast
53:18
that he has torn me from thy hand and my thy fold. Save me, O Christ, whether I want it or not, for thou art my God from
53:25
my mother's womb. come quickly to help me for I perish. Um I don't know there's
53:30
like one more line you want me to finish. No, thank you. Thank you for reading that out. Yeah. So what So it spoke about So it spoke about like
53:37
faith and faith being sufficient. Yep. And works not being required,
53:42
right? Do you believe that? So do you believe that if someone just trust so someone just trusts today
53:48
that Jesus paid for their sin? They haven't done any good works then are they not justified at that moment in
53:54
going to heaven? Well, yeah, but I mean I do trust in God's mercy and and that's why but we
54:02
don't Yeah, we we're not we don't presume it though. What we do is we try to live according to what he says.
54:07
I think when we talk about faith in God, we're talking about trusting in his promises, what he's done for us. So then
54:13
does Jesus promise us eternal life if we believe?
54:19
Uh yes. Yeah. So therefore if you believe then
54:24
you should be like I know I have eternal life. I know I'm 100%. Why would I do that?
54:29
Because then that's part of what it's not what it means to believe. If Jesus gave us salvation, correct?
54:35
What do we have to boast about? [snorts] Right? I'm not saying we're boasting in something you did, but you can boast in
54:42
Christ itself. As Paul says, I boast not in myself, but in what Christ has done. You can boast in Christ.
54:47
So therefore, like if I if I let's say you said to me that you going to bring me dinner tomorrow and if I trust,
54:56
right? Yeah. It would be a work. Yeah. Right. But if you going to do that for me, I wouldn't say, "Look, I'm only 20%
55:03
sure he's going to bring me dinner. I'm only 50% sure." If I truly trusted you, I'd be like, I'm fully certain he's
55:09
going to bring that as he as he promised. And so, if Jesus promised eternal life to everyone who believes,
55:14
then therefore, we should be like, I'm 100% going to heaven. I have eternal life because of what Jesus done. I trust
55:20
in his I would be I would be more just grateful and then trying to see how I could follow his will here on earth.
55:26
But, isn't that important? You aren't going to be grateful for it if you don't think you're going to get it. Do you see that? When I chat to
55:34
Orthodox people all the time, there's I'm not sure if I go to heaven. Hopefully, God wills, God have mercy on me, but I'm not sure 100% if I'm going
55:40
to heaven. I'm conf I'm confident in the promises of Christ while knowing my own sinful
55:45
nature. I mean, I think that you could agree with both of those things existing, right? But just like if you promise to bring
55:51
that food over for me tomorrow, not contingent on something I do for you, but just your promise to me. Therefore,
55:57
even if I mess up greatly tomorrow, you're still going to bring that over because you promised. It was a one-sided
56:02
promise. I didn't have to do anything for you for you to fulfill that. And so salvation is exactly like that. It is a
56:08
one-sided promise. God made a promise to us. We receive it by faith. Let's use your analogy. And you're going
56:14
to bring me dinner tomorrow. And then I look at it and for some awful reason, because I'm a nasty person, I say, you
56:20
know what? This wasn't what I wanted. Goodbye. How does that equivalent if if the
56:25
analogy represents heaven? When you get to heaven, you're not going to say, I don't want heaven. Because you're a perfectly sanctified person there. So
56:31
you wouldn't say that. So that analog the changing analogy doesn't work. Yeah. Really?
56:36
All right. Well, [laughter] look, I' I think this has been an interesting discussion. Um I think actually
56:42
Can I tell you my answer? Let me tell you my answer. What I would tell God if God asked me why should be led to heaven. I would simply say because Jesus
56:49
Christ died on the cross to pay for all my sins. That's the reason why I know you you let me into heaven. Now, what do you think about that
56:55
answer? I think I think it's a I mean I I feel like it's a little for me it's a little
57:03
alien because I feel like like repenting would be important. Um
57:11
I don't know and we I I want to get off and I think this is the difference. This is the difference is that my answer was
57:17
relying fully on what Jesus did. What you think is required is your prayers, your avoiding of sin, your baptism, the
57:24
things. I think that I think that but I think that the baptism as mentioned in Acts 3:28 is a requirement. But the
57:32
whole point is they are all parts of our walk with God. I don't believe that sanctification is immediate. I believe
57:38
it's a process. But I agree. I think it's I think sanctification is a process. 100% agree
57:43
with that. But I my sanctification doesn't play a part in get getting me to heaven. All right. Right. My baptism doesn't play a part.
57:50
Wait, this was way better than I thought. I I I hope we can talk again soon. Yeah, it' be good. Thanks for
57:55
coming out, man. Take care.

<summary>Arguments summaries</summary>

## 1) Identity / “True Orthodox” vs mainstream Orthodoxy (ecumenism, 1924)

### Pro: True Orthodox priest

* **Claim:** He’s “true Orthodox,” rejects ecumenism; mainstream Orthodoxy is compromised. **[0:10–0:22, 2:20–3:32]**
* **Claim:** “True Orthodox” = Orthodoxy **before 1924**; worldwide schism; true Orthodox parishes/bishops exist in many countries. **[3:01–3:32]**
* **Evidence used:** 20th-century communist persecution and alignment with martyrs vs “taken over” churches. **[2:47–3:12]**

### Con: Presbyterian (Ryan)

* No direct pushback on this identity/history claim in this segment (he pivots to salvation).

---

## 2) Salvation: Faith alone vs faith + baptism/church life/commandments

### Pro: Presbyterian (Ryan)

* **Claim:** Saved “by grace through faith, not by works.” **[1:26–1:44]**
* **Claim:** His channel/ministry focus is “how to be saved,” assurance matters. **[1:51–2:09]**
* **Claim:** Worst person / deathbed genuine trust in Christ → saved, even without baptism/church participation. **[6:09–6:51]**
* **Thief on cross** as deathbed-style example. **[7:31–7:43]**
* **Core formula:** Trust Christ took punishment → heaven. **[6:34–6:46, 39:24–40:12]**
* **Verses cited (belief → life/salvation):**

  * “Whoever believes has eternal life” (John 6:47). **[13:04–13:53]**
  * John 6:35/40 emphasis on believing/coming. **[14:10–14:29]**
  * Forgiveness by faith examples:

    * Luke 7 (“Your sins are forgiven… your faith has saved you”). **[11:16–11:36]**
    * Matthew 9:2 paralytic (“when Jesus saw their faith… your sins are forgiven”). **[12:27–12:39]**
  * Acts 16:31 (“Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved”). **[36:47–37:04]**

### Con: True Orthodox priest

* **Claim:** Salvation norm = repent + be baptized + live the church life (mysteries, commandments, avoid sin). **[3:38–4:04]**
* **Claim:** Deathbed salvation without the normal pattern is “possible” in some cases, but not confidently asserted. **[6:51–7:20]**
* **Claim:** General norm is “repent and be baptized for remission of sins.” **[10:51–11:10]**
* **Claim:** If “distance doesn’t matter” (belief alone), why did apostles baptize at all? **[8:41–8:46]**

---

## 3) Baptism: required for salvation or obedience after salvation?

### Pro: Presbyterian (Ryan)

* **Claim:** Baptism is good/commanded, but not necessary for salvation. **[4:22–4:28]**
* **Argument:** Apostles baptize because it’s obedience/public declaration, not what “makes you” God’s child. **[8:46–9:47]**
* **Thief on cross**: saved without baptism. **[7:31–7:43]**
* **Acts 16:31 emphasis:** Paul doesn’t add baptism as a condition in the salvation answer. **[38:23–38:35]**

### Con: True Orthodox priest

* **Claim:** Scripture indicates baptism was required as the early-church norm. **[10:51–11:10]**
* **Acts 16:31–33 point:** Immediately baptized after believing; treats baptism as integral to the pattern. **[37:51–38:23]**

---

## 4) Assurance: can you be 100% sure you’ll go to heaven?

### Pro: Presbyterian (Ryan)

* **Claim:** If someone genuinely believes, they can know they’re saved; otherwise “Believe and you will be saved” becomes meaningless. **[39:24–40:12]**
* **Claim:** Priest’s “I’m not sure; up to God” undermines gospel certainty. **[38:47–40:12, 54:07–55:20]**
* **Argument:** Promise analogy—if you trust a promise, you’re not 20% sure; you’re confident. **[54:47–56:02]**
* **Verses used for certainty/keeping:**

  * John 6:37 (“whoever comes… I will never cast out”). **[43:31–43:43]**
  * John 6:44 (“draws… I will raise him up”). **[44:09–44:21]**
  * Romans 8:30 (justified → glorified). **[44:21–44:27]**
  * Jude theme: God “keeps/guards” believers (he paraphrases this earlier). **[27:29–27:43]**

### Con: True Orthodox priest

* **Claim:** Can’t say 100% because you can still fall away/apostatize; don’t “presume.” **[40:29–40:54, 54:02–54:07]**
* **Argument:** Salvation involves order/ongoing faithfulness; God reads hearts; outcomes may be left to God. **[39:42–40:06, 7:14–7:26]**

---

## 5) Eucharist and John 6: literal eating vs figurative believing

### Pro: True Orthodox priest (Eucharistic / “real eating” reading)

* **Claim:** John 6:53ff is literal enough that Jesus “doubles down,” people leave. **[15:14–16:23, 17:01–17:33]**
* **Greek argument:** verb shifts to “animal eating / munching” to intensify literalness. **[17:13–17:33]**
* **Historical evidence:** early Christians accused/martyred for “cannibalism” due to Eucharist language. **[18:03–18:22]**
* **Claim:** Not “either/or”—John 6 expresses the same truth the Synoptics present more graphically. **[21:52–22:10]**

### Con: Presbyterian (Ryan) (figurative / belief reading)

* **Claim:** John 6 repeatedly defines eternal life by **believing**; therefore 6:53 must be metaphor for believing/coming. **[13:04–15:02, 20:33–20:56]**
* **Argument:** If Peter already has eternal life by believing (6:68–69), and Eucharist isn’t instituted yet, 6:53 can’t be a Eucharist requirement. **[20:16–20:50]**
* **Verse cited:** John 6:63 (“The flesh is no help… words are spirit and life”). **[21:40–21:52]**
* **Claim:** “This is my body… do in remembrance” implies memorial pointing, not cannibalistic literal eating. **[23:14–23:25]**

---

## 6) Fasting before communion vs 1 Corinthians 11 (“eat at home”)

### Pro: True Orthodox priest

* **Claim:** Yes, typically fast from night before communion (with exceptions). **[24:20–24:30]**
* **Counter to “you’ll be hungry” objection:** If you ate the night before, you’re fine; fasting is normative discipline. **[25:06–25:20]**
* **Claim:** 1 Cor 11 is about the agape meal context/abuse, not a condemnation of fasting discipline. **[26:02–26:07]** (briefly stated)

### Con: Presbyterian (Ryan)

* **Argument:** Paul says if you’re hungry, eat at home so the gathering isn’t for judgment; suggests fasting rule conflicts with Paul’s instruction. **[24:36–25:56]**
* **Verse cited:** 1 Corinthians 11:33–34 (quoted). **[25:44–25:56]**

---

## 7) Prayer + fasting / exorcism and manuscript authority (Matt 17:21 dispute)

### Pro: True Orthodox priest

* **Claim:** Rejecting Matt 17:21 is dangerous; church preserved texts; treat words of Jesus with gravity. **[29:42–30:19, 32:24–33:12]**
* **Claim:** Trust church tradition (“I have faith”) over “modern scholarship rejecting verses.” **[30:26–31:05]**
* **Claim:** Without prayer/fasting the church loses ability against “this kind” of demon (corporate/disciplinary framing). **[31:58–32:12]**

### Con: Presbyterian (Ryan)

* **Claim:** Matt 17:21 isn’t in earliest manuscripts; ESV omits; want what Matthew wrote, not later additions. **[28:00–28:24, 28:55–29:37]**
* **Argument:** “Just because someone claims Jesus said it doesn’t mean he did”—analogies to other groups claiming extra sayings. **[32:42–33:25]**
* **Claim:** Every translation is limited by manuscripts available at the time; more manuscripts exist now than 400 years ago. **[29:25–29:37]**

---

## 8) Perseverance vs falling away (Judas / prodigal framing)

### Pro: True Orthodox priest (falling away possible)

* **Claim:** You can “walk out” (prodigal son analogy); not stronger than God, but apostasy is real. **[43:43–43:55, 56:14–56:25]**
* **Judas used as example:** one disciple is “a devil,” shows betrayal within disciples. **[41:58–42:17]**

### Con: Presbyterian (Ryan) (perseverance/false-professor framing)

* **Claim:** Judas wasn’t a saved believer who lost salvation; he never truly believed. **[42:28–43:14]**
* **Evidence cited:** John 12:6 (Judas thief; character evidence). **[42:46–42:58]**
* **Verses cited:** John 6:64 (Jesus knew who didn’t believe), John 6:70–71. **[43:14–43:26]**

---

## 9) “What would you say to God?” (basis of entry)

### Pro: Presbyterian (Ryan)

* **Answer:** “Because Jesus Christ died to pay for all my sins.” **[56:42–56:55]**
* **Argument:** If Christ paid 100%, there’s no remaining punishment; assurance should follow. **[49:36–50:48]**

### Con: True Orthodox priest

* **Answer:** “Lord have mercy on me a sinner” (tax collector framing); emphasizes repentance/mercy rather than certainty language. **[44:51–45:09]**
* **Tension point:** says he trusts mercy, but “we don’t presume” and emphasizes living God’s will. **[54:02–54:07]**

---

## 10) The prayer he reads as “self-evidence” (faith > deeds)

### Orthodox priest reads prayer (as evidence of Orthodox emphasis)

* “Save me by thy grace… if saved because of my deeds it’s not a gift… if faith saves the desperate save me… may my faith replace my deeds… justify me…” **[52:34–53:25]**

### Presbyterian response to the prayer

* Uses it to press: if you affirm “faith replaces deeds,” you should affirm immediate justification/assurance. **[53:37–54:24]**

<summary>Verses indicating insufficiency of faith and OSAS</summary>


> **Galatians 5:4** —
> “You have been severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; **you have fallen away from grace**.”


## 1️⃣ Hebrews 6:4–6

> “It is impossible… if they fall away, to restore them again to repentance…”

This is one of the strongest warning passages.

---

## 2️⃣ Hebrews 10:26–29

> “If we go on sinning deliberately… there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins…”

---

## 3️⃣ 2 Peter 2:20–22

> “After escaping the defilements of the world… they are again entangled… the last state has become worse for them than the first.”

---

## 4️⃣ 1 Timothy 4:1

> “Some will depart from the faith…”

---

## 5️⃣ John 15:6

> “If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch…”

---

## Why Galatians 5:4 Is Important

It says:

> “You have fallen away from grace.”

That sounds very strong.

However, Reformed interpreters (like Ryan in your transcript) typically argue:

* Paul is warning people who are abandoning justification by faith.
* “Fallen from grace” means abandoning the grace-principle for law-justification.
* It does **not** mean a truly regenerated person lost salvation.
* It describes those who never truly had saving faith.

Orthodox and Catholic interpreters usually read it more straightforwardly:

* Real Christians can sever themselves from Christ.
* Apostasy is genuinely possible.
