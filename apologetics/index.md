# rejected concepts
1. Monothelitism - Jesus had one will and two natures.

## Monothelitism
Rejected because it is believed that what is not assumed is not healed. A key patristic principle from Gregory of Nazianzus: “That which He has not assumed, He has not healed.” Assumed in this context means Christ took on the full integrity of human nature—mind, will, soul, and body—as created by God NOT that he has to engage in all or specific acts in order to sanctify them.[2]

1. If Christ did not assume a human will then **human willing itself is unredeemed**.
1. Scripture explicitly shows two wills: “Not my will, but Yours be done.” (Luke 22:42)

# common objections

<details>

<summary>slavery</summary>

The bible never endorses slavery. It perscribes standards of treatment for slaves. The reason slavery was not outright banned is that it would have been rejected and led to more suffering whereas perscribing higher ethical standards resulted in less suffering and set the seeds for abolition. 

tldr: **No, the Bible does not endorse slavery. Regulation is not endorsement**

### verses
Exodus 21:20-21
20“Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, 21but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property. - 

Ephesians 6:5-9
5Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 6Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. 7Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, 8because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free.
9And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.

1 Corinthians 7:21-23
21Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so. 22For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave. 23You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings.

<summary>rape</summary>

Poor translation. Context implies they are both willing participants. The woman and the father have the right of refusal.

Deuteronomy 22:28-29
28If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, 29he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.

<summary>Sabbath - How could God rest?</summary>

Quran says he did not rest, Bible says he does.
Suryah 50:38 - He did not have a rest day

Quran assumes God had no tiredness, therefore he did not rest.

Yet another example of the Quran confirming what it contradicts. Theory of cause being Mohammad knew the Sabbath was important but did not know what it means so he affirms the Sabbath then denies its meaning.

<summary>Man cannot see God</summary>

Exodus 33:20

20But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live

Interlocutor then tried to claim this was the only time in history God was seen by man. This is refuted by the multitude of other theophanies.
e.g.
Jacob when he wrestled with God


This is a category error where God is speaking of his divine essence which cannot be percieved not his physical form.

<summary>God shows emotions indicating changing states or lack of knowledge</summary>

If this were the case, it would violate a core Eastern Orthodox principle:
**divine impassibility** (ἀπάθεια), meaning that God does not undergo emotional change,
acquire new states, or actualize passive potency
(Maximus the Confessor, *Ambigua*).

The examples brought up almost always:
* Show humanity changes, not God.
<details>

<summary>Are relational, not ontological</summary>

It describes **effects of the divine action**, not alterations in the divine nature. These are **true revelations**, but not literal descriptions of God’s inner life.
They describe **how God’s unchanging will is experienced by man in time**, not how God undergoes change.

John of Damascus explains divine language:
> “Scripture speaks of God according to what is seen, not according to what He is.”

No new state is actualized in God; what changes is the **mode of participation**
of the creature.

Analogy used by the fathers(John of Damascus, Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, Book I, ch. 11, Basil the Great, Homily on Psalm 33 (34)):<br>
The sun:
* Hardens clay
* Melts wax
* The sun does not change — the receiver does

So, the same divine goodness:
* Appears as mercy to the righteous
* Appears as judgment to the wicked

This even flows down to the EO depiction of the concept of hell as the same source/light experienced in different ways based on the state of the receiver. (Isaac the Syrian, Ascetical Homilies, Homily 84, Gregory of Nazianzus, Oration 45 (On Holy Pascha))

### verses 'showing' emotion
Genesis 6:6-7
 6The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. 7So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”
