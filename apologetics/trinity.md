# Monarchial Trinitarianism

1. hypostatic properties - properties of the person in the trinity e.g. the son is begotten
1. essential properties - properties necessary of the essence. In the trinity this means the divine essense or divine being in which all hypostasis share in e.g. omniscience.

```text
L: I am not referring to hypostatic properties, I am referring to essential properties; Is being unbegotten an essential property?
N: No, not in regards to the essence
L: So X could be truly God while being begotten
N: Yes
L: An essential property is a necessary property?
N: Yes
L: A non-essential property is?
N: not necessary
L: So the father, it is not necessary for him to be unbegotten?
N: It's not necessary for him to be unbegotten in so far as the essence
L: So the father, in his divinity, could be begotten?
N: it is not necessary
L: So the father, it's not necessary for him to be unbegotten?
N: No, not in regards to the essence
L: So the father, in his divinity, could be begotten?
N: in his essence?
L: Mhmm
N: No, the essence is essential and unbegotten
L: So being unbegotten is essential. The essence is just a set of essential properties that each person has?
N: Yes
L: Each person has the same set of essential properties?
N: Yes in so far as the essence
L: The essence is just a set of essential properties so you saying in so far as the essence is meaningless
N: Incorrect, you could have essential hypostatic properties
L: Ok that's fine. Is being ingenerate an essential property or not?
N: it is an essential property of the essence
L: So X has to be ingenerate in order to have the divine essence?
N: No
L: So the essence is a set of essential properties correct?
N: Yes
L: Do all the person share the set of essential properties?
N: Yes
L: Is being ingenerate an essential property?
N: In regards to the essence, yes
L: That is to say for X to be God then X must be ingenerate?
N: In so far as the essence yes
L: So Jesus is ingenerate?
N: In so far as the essence yes
L: The person has essential properties that make him God and hypostatic properties that make him a person?
N: Yes
L: So we can say Christ is unbegotten?
N: yes in so far as the essence
L: No I am talking about the subject Christ
N: Not if you are talking about the person only if you are talking about the essence
L: Persons possess essential divine nature properties and hypostatic properties but the properties are predicated to the person?
N: Yes - cutoff
L: So being ingenerate is not essential to the essence?
N: It's essential to the essence AND a property of the hypostasis of the father
L: The essential properties are common between the persons, yes?
N: If you are talking about the essential properties of the essence then yes they will be common to the persons.
L: Ok, that is to say the father is ingenerate because that's an essential divine making property.
N: Yes in so far as his essence.
L: So the same way the father is ingenerate in so far as his essence, the son is ingenerate in so far as his essence?
N: Yes in his very essence
L: So Jesus is unbegotten?
N: In his essence he's unbegotten
L: No is the essence a different subject now?
N: Do you think the person is identical to the essence?
L: What essence? When you say essence you are being ambiguous here what are you referring to?
L: So the father is ingenerate in the same way the son is ingenerate?
N: yes.
L: And he's unbegotten because that's an essential divine property?
N: Not just that, its also an essential hypostatic property of the father
L: So he has two properties of being unbegotten?
N: The person in his relation is unbegotten as well as his essence
L: So he has two properties of being ingenerate?
N: Yes we just defined that person and nature have two distinctions
L: So the father is unbegotten correct?
N: yes
L: And the son is also unbegotten correct?
N: yes if you are referring to his essence
L: So can you say the son is unbegotten?
N: only in so far as his essence
L: So say Jesus is unbegotten please?
N: only if you're referring to his essence

## Commentary & Analysis
Muslim is utilizing bait and switch and ambiguous questions to attempt to force the Christian into a saying a clippable contradiction about the trinity.
Libayano then repeats the request for the verbatim phrase that jesus is unbegotten multiple times. He tries to get an uqualified yes to `"Does Nick have a soul"`. This is ambiguous logically because it could be referring to the nature or the individual so an unqualified yes is ambiguous to the question: `"Does Nick have a soul?"`. **REFUSE** to answer since they did not qualify the sense in which they are asking you are not bound to answer in an unqualfied way. They need it to be consecutive so they can clip it.

### 1. Category Shifting (Essence ↔ Hypostasis)
There are two distinct categories:
1. Essential - In this context means anything qualified with divine as well as essence, substance and being.
1. Non-essential - refers to the properties of the hypostatic persons; father, son and holy spirit.


1. Switch 1 from essential to non-essential
<details>

```text
N: not necessary
L: So the father, it is not necessary for him to be unbegotten? <details>
```
He's now asked about a specific hypostasis, violating his own framing. Common bait and switch: `I am not talking about or interested in or going to talk about X, now how does this apply to X?` This violates the original framing and introduces equivocation. Note the qualified answer.


`N: It's not necessary for him to be unbegotten in so far as the essence`

</details>

1. Switch 2 from non-essential to essential

<details>

`L: So the father, in his divinity, could be begotten?`


Now he's asking about the essence/substance/essential properties


`N: it is not necessary`
</details>

1. Swith 3 from essential to non-essential

<details>

`L: So the father, it's not necessary for him to be unbegotten?` 


Now he's asking about the hypostatic person, the father explicitly.


`N: No, not in regards to the essence`

</details>

1. Switch 4 from non-essential to essential

<details>

`L: So the father, in his divinity, could be begotten?` 

He's gone back to the substance, note Nick clarifies the context.


```text
N: in his essence? 
L: Mhmm
N: No, the essence is essential and unbegotten
```
</details>

1. switch 5 from essential to non-essential

<details>

`L: So X has to be ingenerate in order to have the divine essence?` 

Clearly again asking about a non-essential property which the answer is obviously not since X is a hypostasis, which is again the thing he is pretending not to ask about, not the essence.

`N: No`

</details>


1. switch 6 from non-essential to essential
<details>

```text
L: So the essence is a set of essential properties correct?
N: Yes
```
</details>

1. switch 7 immediate switch to essential from non-essential

<details>

```text
L: Do all the person share the set of essential properties?
N: Yes
L: Is being ingenerate an essential property?
N: In regards to the essence, yes
```

</details>

1. switch 8 switch to non-essential from essential

<details>

```text
L: That is to say for X to be God then X must be ingenerate?
N: In so far as the essence yes
L: So Jesus is ingenerate?
N: In so far as the essence yes
```

</details>



### 2. Ambiguity as a Rhetorical Trap

<details>

The repeated demand for an **unqualified affirmation** (“Jesus is unbegotten”) is
designed to suppress the necessary distinction between:

* **what** is predicated (essence vs person)
* **how** it is predicated (essential vs hypostatic)

This allows for deceptive clipping once the qualification is removed.

</details>

---

### 3. The Core Logical Error

<details>

If an essential property is common to all persons, then:

* Predicating it *essentially* does **not** distinguish persons.
* Predicating it *hypostatically* must be exclusive.

Attempting to do both simultaneously without qualification results in contradiction.

</details>

---

### 4. False Binary Framing (“Either / Or” Pressure)

<details>

A recurring move appears when Nick states:

> *“It’s essential to the essence **AND** a property of the hypostasis of the Father.”*

Rather than engaging the **both/and** distinction, Libayno immediately attempts
to force the answer into a mutually exclusive category.

This reveals a deeper framing strategy rather than a mere misunderstanding.
</details>

<details>

This is a classic case of the **false binary fallacy**, where a question is framed
as if only two mutually exclusive options exist, when in fact the position being
articulated affirms **distinct predicates in distinct modes**.

In Trinitarian theology, it is entirely coherent to say:

- A property is **essential** with respect to nature  
- The same property is **hypostatic** with respect to a person  

These are not competing claims. They answer **different questions**.
</details>

<details>

Because this framework cannot accommodate “both/and” distinctions, the interrogator
must **control the framing** of the question so that:

- Qualifications are suppressed  
- Distinctions are treated as evasions  
- The respondent is forced into an apparent contradiction  

This is why unqualified answers are repeatedly demanded:  
they allow the questioner to later *redefine the sense* in which the answer was given.
</details>

<details>

This pattern is not limited to this exchange.  
It commonly appears in Muslim apologetics when engaging:

- Trinity vs tawḥīd  
- Essence vs person  
- Nature vs will  
- Attribute vs subject  

The pressure always moves in the same direction:
**reduce a layered metaphysical claim into a single exclusive category**.

Once that reduction is achieved, the argument proceeds by accusing the Christian
position of incoherence — a problem introduced by the framing itself.
</details>

<details>

Nick’s statement is internally consistent within classical Christian metaphysics.

The contradiction only appears **after** the forced binary is imposed.
</details>

## Analogy: Why Unqualified Answers Must Be Refused
Here is an example from the Muslim perspective. They would **NEVER** answer the question: `"Is Jesus Yahweh?"` with an unqualified yes or no.

### Case Study

### Unqualified question
**Question:** `Is Jesus Yahweh?`

**Qualfied answer(s):** 
- `In an essential sense, yes.`
- `In a hypostatic identity sense, No.`

If an uqualified answer is demanded, refuse to answer unless question is clarified or ignore them and clarify your answer. In this case you are dealing with poor framing and likely a bad actor so instead of the proper concise format of answer→qualify, you should instead qualify→answer. Refusal is not evasion — it is a demand for logical precision.

### Qualified question
**Question:** `Is Jesus Yahweh, in the essential sense?`
**Unqualified answer:** `Yes.`

Even if one responded `"In an essential sense, yes."` or more appropriatley `"Yes, in the essential sense"`, this is not bad faith or grounds for the cross examiner to demand an uqualified answer, especially given how concise the answer is. On the flip side, if the responder refuses to answer Yes/No up front or concisely, or starts demanding exact definitions for every word both sides have been using the entire debate, you have now likely encountered a bad faith interlocutor hiding behind pedantry to avoid ever giving a concrete answer and therefore ever being open to contradiction.

## Muslim claims ambiguity in context he framed from the outset
<details>

```text
N: Do you think the person is identical to the essence?
L: What essence? When you say essence you are being ambiguous here what are you referring to?`
```

This is a complete self-own displaying exactly what he has been doing the entire cross exam by equivocating on the category he is discussing and providing a bait and switch to try to get an unqualified answer to an unqualified question so that he can assert contradiction in a vacuum. Compounded further by the fact that the question itself was completely qualified in the context and he claims ambiguity.

<details>

## Conclusion

Libayno’s repeated insistence on an unqualified statement
(“Jesus is unbegotten”) mirrors the same logical pressure tactic:

* Collapse distinctions
* Extract a clip
* Reframe context after the fact

The correct response is always **qualification or refusal**.
