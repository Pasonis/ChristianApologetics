# Genesis 'we' and 'us'
<details>

**Location:** Garden of Eden<br>
**Chapter:** Genesis 3<br>
**Narrative Moment:** **FALL → JUDGMENT → EXILE**<br>
**Key Verse:** 3:22<br>
**Claim:** The plural **“us”** is spoken by **YHWH Elohim Himself**, indicating **internal divine plurality**, not polytheism.<br>
**Triune Trajectory:** Undifferentiated plurality → later personal distinction (Mamre, Sodom)<br>

## Claims

<details>
<summary>Speaker Identified: YHWH Elohim — Not Angels</summary>

**Hebrew opening clause:**

> **וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים**
> *“And **YHWH God said**…”*

Key points:

* Speaker is explicitly **יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים**
* Not “an angel of the LORD”
* Not a narrator aside
* This is **direct divine speech**

➡️ Whatever “us” means, **YHWH includes Himself in it**.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Hebrew Grammar: “One of Us” Is Real Plurality</summary>

**Hebrew phrase:**

> **כְּאַחַד מִמֶּנּוּ**
> *“like one **from among us***”

Observations:

* **מִמֶּנּוּ (mimmēnû)** = first-person **plural** suffix
* No grammatical ambiguity
* No manuscript variants reducing it to singular
* Hebrew does **not** use plural suffixes accidentally

➡️ The plurality is **deliberate and intrinsic**, not stylistic filler.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>What Changed: Knowledge, Not Essence</summary>

> “Knowing good and evil”

This does **not** mean:

* Man became divine
* Man joined the Godhead
* Man achieved ontological parity

It means:

* Man now **determines good and evil by autonomous judgment**
* A prerogative that **belongs to God**

The serpent promised divinity (3:5).
God confirms **capacity**, not **status**.

➡️ Man becomes *like* God **in function**, not **in being**.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Immediate Narrative Control Remains Singular</summary>

After the plural statement:

> **וַיְשַׁלְּחֵהוּ יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים**
> *“So **YHWH God sent him out**…”* (3:23)

And:

> **וַיְגָרֶשׁ אֶת־הָאָדָם**
> *“He drove out the man…”* (3:24)

Key observations:

* All **verbs of judgment** are singular
* One will
* One authority
* One executor

➡️ Plural self-reference does **not** fragment divine action.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Cherubim Are Excluded by the Text Itself</summary>

Cherubim appear **after** the statement:

* They are **stationed**, not consulted
* They do **not speak**
* They do **not deliberate**
* They are clearly **creatures**

The text does not say:

> “Like one of us, including the cherubim”

➡️ The “us” precedes and transcends angelic agency.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Canonical Pattern: Plural Deliberation, Singular Action</summary>

Genesis establishes a consistent structure:

| Passage  | Speech                | Action                  |
| -------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Gen 1:26 | “Let **us** make…”    | “So **God created**”    |
| Gen 3:22 | “Like one of **us**…” | “So **YHWH God sent**”  |
| Gen 11:7 | “Let **us** go down…” | “So **YHWH scattered**” |

Pattern:

* **Plural counsel**
* **Singular execution**

➡️ This is **internal plurality**, not competing gods.

</details>

---

## Refutations to common objections

### Judaism / Unitarian Readings

<details>
<summary>“God Is Speaking to Angels”</summary>

This fails textually:

* Angels are **never named** in the speech
* Angels are **never included** in divine self-comparison
* Angels do **not share moral authority**
* Angels are **introduced later**, not here

Most decisively:

* Angels do not create
* Angels do not define good and evil
* Angels do not exercise judgment sovereignty

➡️ The text gives **no warrant** for including angels in “us.”

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>“Plural of Majesty”</summary>

Problems:

* Biblical Hebrew **does not use** first-person plural majesty in narrative speech
* Kings do not say “we” for themselves in Genesis-style prose
* Same speaker alternates freely between **I** and **us** with no stylistic shift

➡️ This explanation is **imported**, not exegeted.

</details>

---

## 🧠 Integrated Theological Observation (Text-Bound)

What the text **contains**:

* One divine speaker (YHWH Elohim)
* First-person plural self-reference
* Shared divine prerogatives
* Unified execution of will

What it **does not contain**:

* Polytheistic gods
* Angelic co-deity
* Philosophical explanation

➡️ This is **raw revelation data**, not later theology.

---

## 🧩 Summary Thesis (Genesis 3:22)

**Genesis 3:22 presents:**

* **One God**
* Speaking **of Himself in the plural**
* Exercising **singular authority**
* In a context that excludes polytheism

The phrase **“like one of us”** is not poetic flourish or accommodation.

It is an **early disclosure**:

> Within the one God exists a plurality capable of shared self-reference, shared knowledge, and shared will — without division.

Which is why **Mamre** and **Genesis 19:24** do not introduce novelty —
they **clarify what Eden already implied**.

# Mamre meal with Abraham
<details>

**Location:** Mamre (Oaks of Mamre)<br>
**Chapters:** Genesis 18–19<br>
**Narrative Flow:** **TENT → THREE → TALK → TEARS**<br>
**Key Verses:** 18:1–5, 9–15, 22<br>
**Claim:** One of the three “men” is explicitly identified as **YHWH**, not merely *representing* Him.<br>
**Triune Roles:** Father – source in heaven · Son – visible LORD & mediator · Spirit – revealer of hearts

## verses

<details>
<summary><a id="mamre-18-1">Genesis 18:1–5</a></summary>

1 The LORD appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was
sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.  
2 Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them,
he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.  
3 He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by.  
4 Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.  
5 Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now
that you have come to your servant.”
</details>

<details>
<summary><a id="mamre-18-9">Genesis 18:9–14</a></summary>

9 “Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him.  
“There, in the tent,” he said.  
10 Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year,
and Sarah your wife will have a son.”  
11 Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.  
12 So Sarah laughed to herself…  
13 Then the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh…?”  
14 “Is anything too hard for the LORD?”

## Claims

<details>
<summary>The Appearance Is Explicitly YHWH - <a href="#mamre-18-1">Genesis 18:1</a></summary>

**Hebrew (opening clause):**

> **וַיֵּרָ֤א אֵלָיו֙ יְהוָ֔ה בְּאֵלֹנֵ֖י מַמְרֵ֑א**
> *“And **YHWH appeared** to him by the oaks of Mamre.”*

This is not interpretive.
This is the **narrator’s voice**.

Key points:

* The verb **וַיֵּרָא (vayyērāʾ)** = *appeared visibly*
* Subject is **יְהוָה (YHWH)**, the covenant name
* This verb is **never** used of abstract influence or indirect action

➡️ The text commits us immediately to **a visible manifestation of YHWH**.
</details>

<details>
<summary>“Three Men” Introduced <b>After</b> YHWH Appears - <a href="#mamre-18-1">Genesis 18:2</a></summary>

> “He lifted up his eyes and behold, **three men** were standing before him…”

Narrative logic matters:

1. **YHWH appears** (v.1)
2. Abraham then sees **three men** (v.2)

The men are not introduced *instead of* YHWH but as the **form in which the appearance occurs**.

Hebrew narrative routinely works this way:

* divine identity → embodied description → progressive clarification

</details>

<details>
<summary>Abraham’s Address — Singular Speech to a Plural Group - <a href="#mamre-18-1">Genesis 18:3</a></summary>

**Hebrew:**

> **וַיֹּאמַ֑ר אֲדֹנָ֗י אִם־נָ֤א מָצָ֙אתִי֙ חֵ֣ן בְּעֵינֶ֔יךָ אַל־נָ֥א תַעֲבֹ֖ר מֵעַ֥ל עַבְדֶּֽךָ**

Crucial observations:

* **אֲדֹנָי (Adonai)** — singular
* **בְּעֵינֶיךָ (in *your* eyes)** — singular pronoun
* Spoken while **three men** are present

This is not grammatical confusion.
It is **selective address**—Abraham recognizes **one** as the principal.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Divine Omniscience: Sarah’s Inner Thoughts - <a href="#mamre-18-9">Genesis 18:12-13</a></summary>

Sarah:

> “She **laughed to herself** (בְּקִרְבָּהּ — *within herself*)”

Response:

> **וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל־אַבְרָהָם**
> *“And **YHWH said** to Abraham, ‘Why did Sarah laugh…?’”*

Key point:

* Sarah is **not speaking aloud**
* The speaker is explicitly **YHWH**
* Angels elsewhere do **not** display intrinsic omniscience

➡️ The text itself draws the conclusion for you.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Promise Authority: “I Will Return” - <a href="#mamre-18-9">Genesis 18:10, 14</a></summary>

> “**I will surely return to you**… and Sarah shall have a son.”

No prophetic formula (“Thus says YHWH”)
No mediation language
The speaker speaks **as the covenant-making God Himself**

This is critical:

* Angels **announce**
* Prophets **relay**
* **YHWH promises**

| Speech Act       | Who Can Do It     | Nature of Authority                |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Promise**      | **YHWH alone**    | Self-binding covenant authority    |
| **Announcement** | Angels **or** God | Declarative / informative          |
| **Relay**        | Prophets (only)   | Mediated speech (“Thus says YHWH”) |

This is not a theological imposition—it is a **pattern enforced by the text itself**.

<details><summary><b>YHWH Promises</b> (Self-Binding Speech)</summary>
	 
### Genesis 18:10, 14 (Mamre)

> “**I will surely return to you**… and Sarah shall have a son.”

**Key features:**

* First-person singular
* No messenger formula
* No appeal to higher authority
* Promise involves **creative power** (life from barrenness)

This is covenantal speech.

### Genesis 17:19

> “**I will establish My covenant** with him as an everlasting covenant.”

Only YHWH:

* establishes covenants
* guarantees outcomes
* binds Himself by oath

### Exodus 6:6–8

> “**I will bring you out… I will redeem you… I will give it to you**.”

This is the classic divine promise formula:

> **“I will” (אֲנִי יְהוָה)**

No angel ever speaks this way.

---
</details>

<details><summary><b>Angels Announce</b> (Never Promise)</summary>

Angels may:

* announce events
* explain divine intent
* deliver messages

But they **never self-bind** or originate covenantal guarantees.

### Genesis 16:11 (Angel to Hagar)

> “**You are pregnant and will give birth to a son.**”

Notice:

* Statement of fact
* No “I will make”
* No covenant language

Contrast with v.10:

> “**I will so greatly multiply your offspring…**”

This is one of the *few* places where the Angel of YHWH speaks in the first person—and it is precisely why this figure is widely recognized as **the Angel of YHWH (a theophanic manifestation)**, not a created angel.

### Luke 1:13–17 (Gabriel to Zechariah)

> “Your wife Elizabeth **will bear** you a son…”

Gabriel:

* announces
* explains
* but never grounds the promise in himself

He explicitly identifies himself as **sent** (Luke 1:19).

---

</details>

<details><summary><b>Prophets Relay</b> (Never Originate)</summary>

Prophets **never** promise on their own authority.

They are constrained by formula.

### Jeremiah 1:7

> “**Whatever I command you, you shall speak.**”

### Jeremiah 7:23

> “**This is what I commanded them…**”

### Ezekiel 2:7

> “You shall speak My words to them.”

And most importantly:

### Universal Prophetic Formula

> **כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה**
> *“Thus says YHWH”*

This formula exists for one reason:
**the prophet is not the source**.

If a prophet spoke the way Genesis 18:10 speaks, it would be **blasphemy**.

<summary>Explicit Differentiation Within the Group - <a href="#mamre-18-22">Genesis 18:22</a></summary>
 
**Hebrew:**

> **וַיִּפְנוּ֙ מִשָּׁ֣ם הָאֲנָשִׁ֔ים וַיֵּלְכ֖וּ סְדֹ֑מָה וְאַבְרָהָ֖ם עֹודֶ֥נּוּ עֹמֵֽד לִפְנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה**

Literal:

> *“The men turned from there and went toward Sodom, **but Abraham was still standing before YHWH**.”*

This verse **collapses the angel-only reading**.

* Two go to Sodom → later explicitly called **angels** (19:1)
* One remains → explicitly **YHWH**

The narrator does not hedge.
He does not say “before the Lord’s angel.”
He says **before YHWH**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Continuity Into Genesis 19:24 - <a href="#mamre-19-24">Genesis 19:24</a></summary>

* **YHWH on earth** speaks with Abraham
* **YHWH in heaven** rains judgment
* Same divine name
* Different locations
* Unified action

Genesis 18–19 is a **single literary unit**, not two unrelated scenes.

</details>

---

## Refutations to common objections

### Judiasm
<details>
<summary>“Agency” Explanation</summary>

Common claim:

> “The angel speaks *as* God.”

But the text contradicts this:

* Angels are **distinguished** from YHWH (18:22; 19:1)
* The narrator—not Abraham—identifies YHWH
* YHWH speaks **about** Abraham to YHWH (cf. 18:17–19)
* Genesis 19:24 requires **YHWH-from-YHWH**

Agency models explain *representation*.
They do **not** explain:

* shared divine name
* mutual speech
* simultaneous presence
* personal sourcing

</details>

---

## 🧠 Integrated Theological Observation (Text-Bound)

What the text **contains** (not later philosophy):

* **One divine name (YHWH)**
* **More than one personal subject**
* **Visible and invisible manifestation**
* **Direct divine speech**
* **Unified will and action**

What it **does not yet contain**:

* Hypostasis terminology
* Essence/energy language
* Creeds

➡️ Which is exactly what we would expect of **progressive revelation**, not anachronism.

---

## 🧩 Summary Thesis (Mamre)

**Genesis 18 presents:**

* A visible YHWH
* Distinct from yet united with YHWH in heaven
* Acting personally, speaking covenantally, knowing omnisciently

The “third man” is **not merely an angel**.
The Hebrew text **forces** the identification:

**This is YHWH appearing in human form—without ceasing to be YHWH in heaven.** Importantly:
* The text never separates their action
* Yet it does distinguish their modes
* This is economic distinction, not ontological division.

The Triune Logic Embedded in the Scene

* The Son / Visible YHWH
	* is physically present
	* speaks audibly
	* makes covenant promises

* The Spirit
	* reveals Sarah’s interior state
	* supplies omniscient knowledge

* The Father
	* remains the transcendent source
	* later rains judgment “from heaven” (Gen 19:24)

# Lord Rains Fire
<details>

Focusing on the **Hebrew grammar**, **syntax**, and **narrative flow** that makes the **“LORD-from-the-LORD”** reading not only possible but *textually natural*—and why this strongly supports **personal distinction without ontological division**, exactly what Trinitarian theology later articulates.

> <a id="mamre-19-24">Genesis 19:24</a> "24Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord out of the heavens."

> **וַֽיהוָ֗ה הִמְטִ֧יר עַל־סְדֹ֛ם וְעַל־עֲמֹרָ֖ה גָּפְרִ֣ית וָאֵ֑שׁ מֵאֵ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה מִן־הַשָּׁמָֽיִם׃**

Literal rendering (wooden, but precise):
> *“And **YHWH** rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah sulfur and fire **from YHWH** out of the heavens.”*

1. **Two Explicit Occurrences of the Divine Name (יְהוָה)**
	* **וַֽיהוָ֗ה** (*wayYHWH*) — subject of the verb
	* **מֵאֵ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה** (*me’et YHWH*) — source/origin

This is **not** a poetic repetition like “the king from the king.”
It is **agent → source** language.

* Hebrew does **not** need to repeat proper nouns.
* The repetition is **intentional**.

1. **The Preposition מֵאֵת (*me’et*) — “from the presence / from beside”**

This is not the generic **מִן (*min*)** alone.

* **מֵאֵת** implies **personal source**, often used in contexts of:
  * authority delegation
  * sent agency
  * relational origin

Examples elsewhere:
* A decree coming **from** a king
* A gift coming **from** a person

➡️ This implies **relational distinction**, not mere spatial distance.

1. **Spatial Distinction Is Explicit**
	* One **YHWH** is **acting on earth**
	* One **YHWH** is located **“in the heavens”** (*min-hashamayim*)

This matches **Genesis 18–19’s narrative flow** from when he appears at Mamre:
* One LORD **remains with Abraham**
* Two angels go to Sodom
* The LORD on earth executes judgment
* Judgment proceeds **from** YHWH in heaven

---

## Modalism refutation
Modalism would require:

* One person
* Merely changing “roles” or “manifestations”

But the text gives:

* **Simultaneous action**
* **Relational sourcing**
* **Distinct locations**

A single person cannot:

* Be **the acting agent**
* And simultaneously be the **source-from-whom the action proceeds**
* While remaining personally identical *without* collapsing grammar

Hebrew has **simpler ways** to say “God rained fire from heaven.”
It **does not use them here**.


## 🧩 **Trinitarian Reading (Without Anachronism)**


**clearly contains**:

* **Personal distinction**
* **Shared divine name**
* **Unified action**

This is exactly what later theology *clarifies*, not invents.

| Role                  | Evidence                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Father**            | YHWH “in the heavens” — source                           |
| **Son (Logos)**       | Visible, speaking, judging YHWH on earth                 |
| **Spirit (implicit)** | Omniscience (Sarah’s thoughts), execution of divine will |


This excerpt does **not** yet articulate:

* Essence/energy distinctions
* Hypostatic terminology
* Nicene metaphysics

---

## Judiasm idiom refuted

> “This is just Hebrew idiom.”

**Problem:**
There is **no parallel** where:

* A single person is named twice
* As agent and source
* With explicit spatial distinction
* Without clarifying apposition

If Moses meant:

> “The LORD rained fire from heaven”

He would write:

> *וַיהוָה הִמְטִיר … מִן־הַשָּׁמַיִם*

He **did not**.

The **spatial logic** the Hebrew assumes:

* Mamre (Abraham + LORD)
* Sodom (judgment)
* Heaven (source)

---

## 🧠 **Summary Thesis**

**Genesis 19:24 is one of the clearest Old Testament texts demonstrating:**

> **One divine being (YHWH)**
> **Personally distinct agents**
> **Acting simultaneously**
> **Without division of essence**

This is not “later Christian theology read back.”
It is **what the Hebrew text actually says**—and later theology merely gives it vocabulary.
