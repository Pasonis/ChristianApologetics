# Main argument
* If the Quran is not the clear, preserved and authorative word of God then Islam is false. 
* If Quran is the clear, preserved and authorative word of God then Islam is false because it confirms the previous scriptures as the truth which it then contradicts.
* Either way, Islam is false.

## Support
1. Scriptural authority

## variants
1. the clear quran dilemma
1. would you trust a religion with corrupted scripture

## Common Muslim objections
These are the things Muslims commonly say, even though most only treat one horn of the dilemma and the rest are completely unfalsiable, unspported in the Quran, by any scholarly work and in direct conflict with all manuscript evidence.

1. 5:48 - Quran is authorative over the torah and injeel
1. The mythical uncorrupted versions were both in Medina at the time of the verse and then disapeared again.
1. the quran is conciously editing the previous scriptures
1. the gospel and or torah are corrupt
	1. 5:14
1. the Q gospel

# concepts
1. command reading
1. purpose reading
1. 6 pillars of islam - explicitly includes the previous scriptures as part of Islam

<summary>The quran claims some verses are elusive</summary>

Family of Imran (3:7) 

هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ مِنْهُ ءَايَـٰتٌۭ مُّحْكَمَـٰتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ ۖ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌۭ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَـٰبَهَ مِنْهُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ ٱلْفِتْنَةِ وَٱبْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِۦ ۗ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُۥٓ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ ۗ وَٱلرَّٰسِخُونَ فِى ٱلْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِۦ كُلٌّۭ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا ۗ وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّآ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَـٰبِ ٧

He is the One Who has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book, of which some verses are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—while others are elusive. Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses seeking ˹to spread˺ doubt through their ˹false˺ interpretations—but none grasps their ˹full˺ meaning except Allah. As for those well-grounded in knowledge, they say, “We believe in this ˹Quran˺—it is all from our Lord.” But none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.

The quran is clear and not clear - Contradiction, the quran is false

This relies 100% on the Quran. The clear vs unclear parts are never specified. No epistemological tools are provided to distinguish between clear and unclear verses.

### pitfalls
Do not strawman with things like: 

> "The quran doesn't ever tell me how to do X so it's not a full explanation."

This is an uncharitable strawman and completely unnecessary. The clear and accepted context is that it is a detailed explanation on all things it covers. The contradiction remains of course because it is not clear on many subjects AND directly contradicts itself in 3:7.

Jonah (10:94) 

فَإِن كُنتَ فِى شَكٍّۢ مِّمَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ فَسْـَٔلِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقْرَءُونَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكَ ۚ لَقَدْ جَآءَكَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ ٩٤

If you ˹O Prophet˺ are in doubt about ˹these stories˺ that We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,
— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, The Clear Quran

https://quran.com/10/94

### Context
Allah speaking to Mohammed.

### Implications
One who doubts the Quran should consult those who have read the scriptures that came before to verify that what the Quran says is true.

<summary>Its conditional on doubt</summary>

The Qur’an repeatedly uses conditionals addressed to Muhammad that no Muslim believes apply only to him or imply he actually committed the act.

<details>

<summary>Conditional Threat of Shirk - Qur’an 39:65</summary> 

وَلَقَدْ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ

And verily it hath been revealed unto thee as unto those before thee (saying): If thou ascribe a partner to Allah thy work will fail and thou indeed wilt be among the losers.

https://quranx.com/39.65

Same structure as 10:94 and same rethorical function.

Key facts:
* All Muslims agree Muhammad never committed shirk
* All Muslims agree this verse applies to everyone
* The conditional does not imply actual doubt or risk
* It establishes a universal rule, not a personal scenario

If they say: `“That was only hypothetical”`
Respond: `“Exactly. And yet it establishes a real standard. So does 10:94.”`

<summary>“They almost made you compromise” - Qur’an 17:73–74</summary>

وَإِن كَادُوا۟ لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ لِتَفْتَرِىَ عَلَيْنَا غَيْرَهُۥ ۖ وَإِذًا لَّٱتَّخَذُوكَ خَلِيلًا
وَلَوْلَآ أَن ثَبَّتْنَٰكَ لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْـًٔا قَلِيلًا

And they indeed strove hard to beguile thee (Muhammad) away from that wherewith We have inspired thee, that thou shouldst invent other than it against Us; and then would they have accepted thee as a friend.
And if We had not made thee wholly firm thou mightest almost have inclined unto them a little.

https://quranx.com/17.73
https://quranx.com/17.74

Muslim position:

* Muhammad never compromised
* This is not limited to Muhammad
* It is a warning paradigm for the community

follow-up:
> Why is this conditional universalized, but 10:94 individualized? There is no textual distinction.

<summary>If Muhammad fabricated revelation - Qur’an 69:44–47</summary>

وَلَوْ تَقَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا بَعْضَ ٱلْأَقَاوِيلِ

ثُمَّ لَقَطَعْنَا مِنْهُ ٱلْوَتِينَ
فَمَا مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَٰجِزِينَ

And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us,
We assuredly had taken him by the right hand
And then severed his life-artery,
And not one of you could have held Us off from him.

https://quranx.com/69.44
https://quranx.com/69.45
https://quranx.com/69.46
https://quranx.com/69.47


Muslim view:

* Everyone agrees Muhammad did not fabricate
* Everyone agrees this establishes a test of prophethood
* Everyone agrees this applies beyond Muhammad

ask: `"So how could 10:94 be for “Muhammad-only”?".`

يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ إِنَّآ أَحْلَلْنَا لَكَ أَزْوَٰجَكَ ٱلَّٰتِىٓ ءَاتَيْتَ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ يَمِينُكَ مِمَّآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ وَبَنَاتِ عَمِّكَ وَبَنَاتِ عَمَّٰتِكَ وَبَنَاتِ خَالِكَ وَبَنَاتِ خَٰلَٰتِكَ ٱلَّٰتِى هَاجَرْنَ مَعَكَ وَٱمْرَأَةً مُّؤْمِنَةً إِن وَهَبَتْ نَفْسَهَا لِلنَّبِىِّ إِنْ أَرَادَ ٱلنَّبِىُّ أَن يَسْتَنكِحَهَا خَالِصَةً لَّكَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۗ قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا فَرَضْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِىٓ أَزْوَٰجِهِمْ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُهُمْ لِكَيْلَا يَكُونَ عَلَيْكَ حَرَجٌ ۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا

O Prophet! Lo! We have made lawful unto thee thy wives unto whom thou hast paid their dowries, and those whom thy right hand possesseth of those whom Allah hath given thee as spoils of war, and the daughters of thine uncle on the father's side and the daughters of thine aunts on the father's side, and the daughters of thine uncle on the mother's side and the daughters of thine aunts on the mother's side who emigrated with thee, and a believing woman if she give herself unto the Prophet and the Prophet desire to ask her in marriage - a privilege for thee only, not for the (rest of) believers - We are Aware of that which We enjoined upon them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess - that thou mayst be free from blame, for Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.

<summary>Qur’an 66:1 — rebuke tied to a specific incident</summary>

يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ لِمَ تُحَرِّمُ مَآ أَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ لَكَ ۖ تَبْتَغِى مَرْضَاتَ أَزْوَٰجِكَ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ

O Prophet! Why bannest thou that which Allah hath made lawful for thee, seeking to please thy wives? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

https://quranx.com/66.1

</details>

These verses:

* Include historical markers
* Include exclusive language
* Are treated as non-generalizable by Muslims themselves

Qur’an 10:94 does none of this No:
* Historical event
* Named exception
* Restricting clause
* “This is for you alone” language

Instead, it appeals to a standing community:
> “those who read the Scripture before you”

That phrase cannot be Muhammad-only because:
* Muhammad is not the one doing the asking
* The authority invoked exists outside him
* The verification source is public and ongoing

</details>

#### Rebuttal

Expose special pleading cleanly. You ask one question and then stop talking.

> “Do conditional warnings addressed to Muhammad ever establish universal truths in the Qur’an?”

They must say ""yes" — or Islam collapses.

Then you follow with:

> “What textual marker in 10:94 restricts this one alone?”

There are no such markers, period.

If they say:

> “Scholars say—”

You respond:

> “I asked for a textual marker, not a later theory.”

If they say:

> “Context—”

You respond:

> “Name the contextual limiter, as exists in 33:50 or 66:1.”

If they say:

> “It doesn’t mean what it says—”

You stop engaging — at this point you’ve demonstrated special pleading.

قُلْ يَـٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ لَسْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَىْءٍ حَتَّىٰ تُقِيمُوا۟ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةَ وَٱلْإِنجِيلَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ ۗ وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرًۭا مِّنْهُم مَّآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغْيَـٰنًۭا وَكُفْرًۭا ۖ فَلَا تَأْسَ عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ ٦٨

Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” And your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. So do not grieve for the people who disbelieve.

The Table Spread (5:47) 

وَلْيَحْكُمْ أَهْلُ ٱلْإِنجِيلِ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِ ۚ وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَـٰسِقُونَ ٤٧

So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.
— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, The Clear Quran

https://quran.com/5/47

The Table Spread (5:48) 

وَأَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقًۭا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ وَمُهَيْمِنًا عَلَيْهِ ۖ فَٱحْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ عَمَّا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ ۚ لِكُلٍّۢ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةًۭ وَمِنْهَاجًۭا ۚ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةًۭ وَٰحِدَةًۭ وَلَـٰكِن لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِى مَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمْ ۖ فَٱسْتَبِقُوا۟ ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ ۚ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًۭا فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ ٤٨

And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture with the truth, confirming whatever Scripture was before it, and a watcher over it. So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed, and follow not their desires away from the truth which hath come unto thee. For each We have appointed a divine law and a traced-out way. Had Allah willed He could have made you one community. But that He may try you by that which He hath given you (He hath made you as ye are). So vie one with another in good works. Unto Allah ye will all return, and He will then inform you of that wherein ye differ.
https://quranx.com/5.48

## Self-sufficiency of the Quran (meaning no haddith)
Direct rebuke of using parts. writing things with your own hands and claiming from God. Clear condemnation of twisting the meaning of the text from what Allah revealed.

## 5:48
5:43 sets the tone and standard. Jews are trying to avoid the standards of their book. Mohammad demands to know what the Torah says (and requires someone to tell him becuase he does not know) and then affirms the Torah and all that is in it. The next verse states the Quran guards the previous revelations of truth and light and that each group it to follow its own revelation. Later 66-68 explicitly condemns those who selectively choose which parts to follow and demands adherence to the entirety of the book provided to them.

The context clearly shows this a command reading not a purpose reading.

Truth and light implies whatever they had was not corrupt at that time and if they can't produce the uncorrupted version they have no grounds to claim today's extremely well documented version is corrupted. Also the Quran explicitly affirms and confirms the previous scriptures, it NEVER condemns them or asserts corruption. The only place where this could be possibly inferred is clearly referring to books someone has written with their own hands and not direct corruption of the scriptures.

### the clear quran dilemma
Used to cut off the extremely convoluted answers Muslims will try to give to combat the clear contradictions used in the Islamic dilemma. Also another shortcut to close off the Haddith, scholarship, dish gallop that is usually employed to obfistcate the islamc dilemma.

If the quran is not clear - the quran is false
If the Quran is clear -> Islamic Dilemma -> the quran is false

### objections/counterclaims
1. The Bible is also unclear (self-own on Quran), and therefore false: The Bible never claims to be clear and complete in all verses and chapters etc. It specifically says it is sufficient. (also direct refutation to sola scriptura)

## 2:85 - Whole not parts
ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقًا مِّنكُم مِّن دِيَٰرِهِمْ تَظَٰهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِم بِٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ وَإِن يَأْتُوكُمْ أُسَٰرَىٰ تُفَٰدُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ ۚ أَفَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ ۚ فَمَا جَزَآءُ مَن يَفْعَلُ ذَٰلِكَ مِنكُمْ إِلَّا خِزْىٌ فِى ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ۖ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰٓ أَشَدِّ ٱلْعَذَابِ ۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ

Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression? - and if they came to you as captives ye would ransom them, whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you - Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom. For Allah is not unaware of what ye do.

### Direct context
Mohammed talking to Jews.

### Objections
1. Applies to Jews only

### would you trust a religion with corrupted scripture
> Would you trust a religion with corrupted scripture?
> They answer no
> Do you believe the Torah was revealed by Allah?
> They answer yes
> Do you believe the Torah, Zabor, Injeel have been corrupted?
> They answer Yes all of them

So all of the scriptures except the Quran are corrupted, therefore I don't trust Islam, a religion with corrupted scripture.
