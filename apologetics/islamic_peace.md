<summary>Direct calls to violence</summary>

## Qur’an 9:29 (People of the Book)

> **“Fight those who do not believe in Allah nor the Last Day … from among the People of the Book, until they pay the jizya … and feel themselves subdued.”**


## Conditions

The command is belief-conditional, not conditioned on prior aggression. The verse does not require that Jews or Christians initiate hostilities; it predicates fighting on religious non-compliance.

## What is the alternative to fighting?

The verse itself gives the alternative:

> **“…until they pay the jizya…”**

The jizya is a tax exclusive to unbelievers. Classical Islamic law (fiqh) treats this as **exhaustive**:

### The legal options for People of the Book:

1. **Convert to Islam** (Qur’an 9:11 — repentance + prayer ends hostility)
2. **Pay jizya and submit** (Qur’an 9:29 - the verse in question)
3. **Refuse → continued fighting** (Qur’an 9:29 - the verse in question)

There is **no third peaceful autonomy option** in classical interpretation.

This is not inferred — it is explicit in:

<summary>Hadith</summary>

**Hadith** are narrations reporting the sayings, actions, and approvals of Muhammad. In Sunni Islam, they function as a **primary source of law and practice**, explaining how Qur’anic commands are carried out in concrete terms.

**Hadith – Sahih Muslim 1731**

> “When you meet your enemy among the polytheists, call them to three things… If they refuse Islam, then ask them to pay the jizya. If they refuse, then seek Allah’s help and fight them.

<summary>Tafsir</summary>

Means Explanation. Exegesis and Isogesis that describes who a command applies to and what ends it

**Ibn Kathir (Tafsir 9:29)**

> “Allah commands fighting the People of the Book until they either accept Islam or pay the jizya. If they do so, their lives and property are protected.”

**Al-Tabari (Tafsir 9:29)**

> “Fight them until they submit to the rule of Islam, either by embracing the faith or by paying the jizya. If they refuse both, then fighting against them continues.”

</details>

<details>

<summary>Sīra</summary>

Historical accounts of Muhammad's life and early Muslim communities.

**Ibn Kathir – Al-Bidaya wa’l-Nihaya**

> “The People of the Book were subdued, and the jizya was taken from them in a manner that made their submission and lowliness apparent.”

</details>

<details>

<summary>Fiqh manuals</summary>

**Fiqh manuals** codify Islamic law as applied under Muslim governance, synthesizing Qur’an, Hadith, and early practice into enforceable legal rules, including taxation, warfare, and non-Muslim status.

**Al-Mawardi – Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya**

> “The jizya is taken from them with humiliation and subjugation, in order that the superiority of Islam be manifest.”

</details>

Refusal of jizya **does not pause the command** — it **extends the fighting**. Meaning refusal results in the continuation of armed hostilities, with death or coercive subjugation as foreseeable outcomes.

## What does “feel themselves subdued” mean?

Arabic phrase:

> **وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ** (*wa-hum ṣāghirūn*)

This does **not** mean merely “politically subordinate.”

### Classical definitions:

* **Ṣāghir** = humbled, lowered, made small

<details>

<summary>forced humiliation </summary>

**Ibn Kathir (Tafsir 9:29)**

> “They pay it while they are humiliated (ṣāghirūn), disgraced, and subdued, not honored.”

</details>

<details>

<summary>visible inferiority</summary>

**Al-Qurtubi – Tafsir on Qur’an 9:29**

> “The meaning of ṣāghirūn is that they are humiliated and subdued. It is said: they come themselves to pay the jizya, walking, not riding, standing while the collector sits.”

</details>

<details>

<summary>social abasement</summary>

**Al-Tabari (Tafsir 9:29)**

> “Ṣāghirūn means lowly, humbled, and compliant, acknowledging the dominance of Islam over them.”

</details>

---

## How was this applied in practice?

Classical jurists did not treat this abstractly.

Examples from fiqh manuals:

<details>

<summary>Jizya paid **in person**</summary>

**Al-Qurtubi (Tafsir 9:29):**

> “They do not send it; they come with it themselves.”

</details>

<details>

<summary>Non-Muslim stands while Muslim sits</summary>

**Al-Qurtubi (Tafsir 9:29):**

> “He stands while the collector sits.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Physical gestures of submission required</summary>

**Ibn Qayyim – Ahkam Ahl al-Dhimma**

> “They are made to feel their smallness and subjugation when paying the jizya.”

</details>

<details>

<summary>Legal inequality explicitly codified</summary>

**Umar’s Pact (Covenant of ʿUmar)**

> “We shall not resemble the Muslims in dress, speech, or posture… We shall show deference to Muslims in public.”

</details>

This was **intentional**, not incidental. Classical tafsir, sīra, and fiqh unanimously interpret ṣāghirūn (Qur’an 9:29) as requiring not merely political subordination, but visible, embodied humiliation, codified in law and enacted through posture, payment rituals, and social inequality.

---

## Is violence perpetual?

* The **command to fight remains in force**
* It **ceases temporarily** when jizya is paid
* It **resumes** if:

  * jizya is refused
  * submission is withdrawn
  * Islamic authority is challenged

Sources:
* Umar’s Pact
* Al-Nawawi
* Ibn Qayyim

So the peace is **conditional and revocable**.

---

## Final clarity

### Qur’an 9:29 teaches:

* ✔ Fighting is commanded **because of religious non-belief**
* ✔ Jews and Christians are named explicitly
* ✔ Jizya is a coerced alternative to continued warfare
* ✔ Submission includes **social humiliation**
* ❌ No allowance for neutral coexistence without submission

So while it is not:

* “Kill them wherever you find them”

It **is**:

* “Fight them until they accept permanent inferiority”

## Dodges

### Verbatim fallacy

**Objection:** `It doesn't explicitly say “kill,” “behead,” etc.`

**Response:** `Islamic law does not operate by English literalism but by legal categories and conditional commands. The Qur’an explicitly mandates coercive violence, subjugation, and humiliation even when not phrased in the exact wording demanded. In addition, the Qur’an contains no command to love Jews, Christians, or non-believers, nor does it teach peaceful coexistence as a universal ethic independent of submission or treaty. Armed struggle is justified on the basis of religious non-compliance, while peace is conditional—secured either through submission to Islamic authority (e.g., jizya) or through temporary treaty.`
